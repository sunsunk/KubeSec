# OpenCost â€” your favorite open source cost monitoring tool for Kubernetes and cloud spend

OpenCost give teams visibility into current and historical Kubernetes and cloud spend and resource allocation.
These models provide cost transparency in Kubernetes environments that support multiple applications, teams, departments, etc.
It also provides visibility into the cloud costs across multiple providers.

OpenCost was originally developed and open sourced by [Kubecost](https://kubecost.com). This project combines a [specification](/spec/) as well as a Golang implementation of these detailed requirements.
