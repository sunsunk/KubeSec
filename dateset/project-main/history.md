# History

OpenGitOps was initially created and guided by the CNCF [GitOps Working Group](https://github.com/cncf/tag-app-delivery/tree/main/gitops-wg), which was part of the CNCF [App Delivery TAG](https://github.com/cncf/tag-app-delivery).
In March 2024 The GitOps WG merged into the OpenGitOps project to simplify project governance and the path for new contributors.
