The development mode of DevSpace can be started using the `-i / --interactive` flag which overrides the `ENTRYPOINT` of an image with `[sleep, 999999]` and opens an interactive terminal session for one of the containers that use the 'sleeping' image. Due to the `ENTRYPOINT` override, the application has not been started within the container and the user can start the application manually through the interactive terminal session.

## Start Interactive Mode
Start the interactive mode using this command:
```bash
devspace dev -i
```
