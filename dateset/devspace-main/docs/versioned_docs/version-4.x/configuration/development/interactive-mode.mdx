title: Configure Interactive Mode
sidebar_label: interactive
---

The development mode of DevSpace can be started using the `-i / --interactive` flag which overrides the `ENTRYPOINT` of an image with `[sleep, 999999]` and opens an interactive terminal session for one of the containers that use the 'sleeping' image. Due to the `ENTRYPOINT` override, the application has not been started within the container and the user can start the application manually through the interactive terminal session.

To control the default behavior when using the interactive mode, you can configure the `dev.interactive` section in the `devspace.yaml`.
```yaml {24-37}
images:
  frontend:
    image: dscr.io/${DEVSPACE_USERNAME}/appfrontend
  backend:
    image: john/appbackend
  database:
    image: john/database
deployments:
- name: app-frontend
  helm:
    componentChart: true
    values:
      containers:
      - image: dscr.io/${DEVSPACE_USERNAME}/appfrontend
- name: app-backend
  helm:
    componentChart: true
    values:
      containers:
      - image: john/appbackend
        name: some-container
      - image: john/appbackend
dev:
  interactive:
    images:
    - name: backend
      entrypoint:
      - tail
      cmd:
      - -f
      - /dev/null
    - name: frontend
      entrypoint:
      - /debug_entrypoing.sh
    terminal:
      imageName: backend
      containerName: some-container
```

## Start Interactive Mode
Start the interactive mode using this command:
```bash
devspace dev -i
```

## Configuration

### `images`
The `images` option expects an array of objects having the following properties:
- `name` stating an image name which references an image in the `images` within `devspace.yaml` (required)
- `entrypoint` defining an [`ENTRYPOINT` override](../../configuration/images/entrypoint-cmd.mdx#entrypoint) that will be applied only in interactive mode (optional)
- `cmd` defining a [`CMD` override](../../configuration/images/entrypoint-cmd.mdx#cmd) that will be applied only in interactive mode (optional)

:::info In-Memory Image Override
`ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD` overrides for interactive mode work the same way as regular [overrides for image building](../../configuration/images/entrypoint-cmd.mdx). However, they take precedence over regular overrides and are only used during interactive mode.
:::

:::note
By default, DevSpace asks which image to override when starting interactive mode (or skips the question if only one image is defined). This image will then be built using the `ENTRYPOINT [sleep, 999999]` override if not configured differently via `images`.
:::

#### Example: Setting Interactive Mode Images
```yaml {25-34}
images:
  frontend:
    image: dscr.io/${DEVSPACE_USERNAME}/appfrontend
  backend:
    image: john/appbackend
  database:
    image: john/database
deployments:
- name: app-frontend
  helm:
    componentChart: true
    values:
      containers:
      - image: dscr.io/${DEVSPACE_USERNAME}/appfrontend
- name: app-backend
  helm:
    componentChart: true
    values:
      containers:
      - image: john/appbackend
        name: some-container
      - image: john/appbackend-sidecar
dev:
  interactive:
    images:
    - name: backend
      entrypoint:
      - tail
      cmd:
      - -f
      - /dev/null
    - name: frontend
      entrypoint:
      - /debug_entrypoing.sh
```
**Explanation:**  
- The above example defines 3 images and 2 deployments.
- The `images` option defines that the image `backend` should be built using a `ENTRYPOINT [tail]` and using `CMD [-f, /dev/null]` when building this image in interactive mode
- The `images` option defines that the image `frontend` should be built using a `ENTRYPOINT [/debug_entrypoint.sh]` when building this image in interactive mode


### `terminal`
The `terminal` option expects an object having the following properties:
- `imageName` to select a container based on an image specified in `images`
- `labelSelector` to select a pod based a Kubernetes label selector
- `containerName` to select a container based on its name (optional, useful if pod has multiple containers)
- `namespace` to select a container from a namespace different than the default namespace of the current kube-context
- `command` defines a command to run when starting the terminal session (default: `/bin/bash` with fallback `/bin/sh`)

:::info Combine Options
The first four options are used to select the appropriate pod / container. If you specify multiple these config options, they will be jointly used to select the pod / container (think logical `AND / &&`).
:::

:::note Command Termination
If `command` is a non-interactive command that terminates, DevSpace will run the command and exits after the command has terminated.
:::

#### Example: Configuring Terminal for Interactive Mode
```yaml {25-27}
images:
  frontend:
    image: dscr.io/${DEVSPACE_USERNAME}/appfrontend
  backend:
    image: john/appbackend
  database:
    image: john/database
deployments:
- name: app-frontend
  helm:
    componentChart: true
    values:
      containers:
      - image: dscr.io/${DEVSPACE_USERNAME}/appfrontend
- name: app-backend
  helm:
    componentChart: true
    values:
      containers:
      - image: john/appbackend
        name: some-container
      - image: john/appbackend-sidecar
dev:
  interactive:
    terminal:
      imageName: backend
      containerName: some-container
```
**Explanation:**  
The above configuration would open the container with name `some-container` that belongs to the deployment `app-backend` when running `devspace dev -i`.


### `defaultEnabled`
The `defaultEnabled` option expects a boolean that determines if interactive mode should be started by default even if no `-i / --interactive` flag was provided.

#### Default Value For `defaultEnabled`
```yaml
defaultEnabled: false
```

#### Example: Enabling Interactive Mode By Default
```yaml
images:
  backend:
    image: john/appbackend
deployments:
- name: app-backend
  helm:
    componentChart: true
    values:
      containers:
      - image: john/appbackend
        name: some-container
      - image: john/appbackend-sidecar
dev:
  interactive:
    defaultEnabled: true
    images:
    - name: backend
      entrypoint:
      - /debug_entrypoing.sh
    terminal:
      imageName: backend
      containerName: some-container
```
**Explanation:**  
Running `devspace dev` with the above configuration leads to:
- during image building: the overrides defined in `images`  would be applied
- after deployment: an interactive terminal session for a container with name `some-container` and with image `john/appbackend` would be started
