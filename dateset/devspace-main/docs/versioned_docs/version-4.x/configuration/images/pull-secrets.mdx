## `createPullSecret`
The `createPullSecret` option expects a boolean that tells DevSpace if a pull secret should be created for the registry where this image will be pushed to.
- If there are multiple images with the **same registry** and any of the images will define `createPullSecret: true`, the pull secret will be created no matter if any of the other images using the same registry explicitly defines `createPullSecret: false`.
- There is **no need to change your Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts or other deployments to reference the pull secret** because DevSpace will [add the pull secret to the service account](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/#add-imagepullsecrets-to-a-service-account) which deploys your project. This ensures that the pull secret is automatically considered by Kubernetes although it is not explicitly referenced by your pods.
- After running `devspace deploy` or `devspace dev`, you should be able to see the auto-generated pull secrets created by DevSpace when you run the command `kubectl get serviceaccount default -o yaml` and take a look at the `imagePullSecrets` section of this service account.

#### Default Value For `createPullSecret`
```yaml
createPullSecret: false
```

#### Example: Different Dockerfiles
```yaml
images:
  backend:
    image: john/appbackend
  frontend:
    image: dscr.io/${DEVSPACE_USERNAME}/appfrontend
    createPullSecret: true
```
**Explanation:**  
- The first image `backend` will be pushed to Docker Hub and DevSpace will **not** create a pull secret for Docker Hub because `createPullSecret` defaults to `false`. This makes sense for public images where no login is required to pull the image or where you want to manage the pull secret yourself.
- The second image `frontend` will be pushed to dscr.io and DevSpace will create a pull secret for dscr.io, so Kubernetes is able to pull the image from dscr.io.
