title: Disable Image Building
sidebar_label: disabled
---

## `disabled`
The `disabled` option expects a boolean and allows you to disable image building for an image.

#### Default Value For `disabled`
```yaml
disabled: false
```

#### Example: Disabling Image Building
```yaml
images:
  frontend:
    image: dscr.io/${DEVSPACE_USERNAME}/appfrontend
    build:
      disabled: true
  backend:
    image: john/appbackend
```
**Explanation:**  
- The first image `frontend` would not be built at all.
- The second image `backend` would be built using [`docker`](../../configuration/images/docker.mdx) because nothing is specified and `docker` is the default build tool for images.
