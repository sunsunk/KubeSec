title: Override ENTRYPOINT and CMD
sidebar_label: entrypoint + cmd
---

:::warning
If you are overriding the Dockerfile `ENTRYPOINT` or `CMD`, it only affects the image but <u>**not**</u> the deployment in Kubernetes. If a deployment using this image defines the `command` or `args` options, they will take precedence over the overrides you define for the image.
:::

### `entrypoint`
The `entrypoint` option expects an array of strings which tells DevSpace to override the `ENTRYPOINT` defined in the `Dockerfile` during the image building process.

:::note
If you are overriding the `ENTRYPOINT`, it is often useful to also [override the `CMD` statement](#cmd). If you want to define `entrypoint: ...` for an image and you do **not** want the `CMD` statement from the Dockerfile, add `cmd: []` to the image configuration in your `devspace.yaml`.
:::

#### Default Value For `entrypoint`
```yaml
entrypoint: []
```

#### Example: Override ENTRYPOINT For Image
```yaml
images:
  backend:
    image: john/appbackend
  frontend:
    image: dscr.io/${DEVSPACE_USERNAME}/appfrontend
    entrypoint:
    - npm
    - run
    - dev
```
**Explanation:**  
- The first image `backend` will be built using the regular `ENTRYPOINT` (e.g. `[npm, start]`) defined by the Dockerfile located in `./Dockerfile`
- The second image `frontend` will be built using the same Dockerfile but instead of the original `ENTRYPOINT`, DevSpace would use the `[npm, run, dev]` as value for `ENTRYPOINT`


## `cmd`
The `cmd` option expects an array of strings which tells DevSpace to override the `CMD` defined in the `Dockerfile` during the image building process.

:::note
`CMD` generally defines the arguments for `ENTRYPOINT`.
