## `custom`
Using `custom` as build tool allows you to define a custom command for building images. This is particularly useful if you want to use a remote build system such as Google Cloud Build.

:::warning
Make sure your `custom` build command terminates with exit code 0 when the build process was successful.
:::

### `command`
The `onChange` option expects an array of strings which represent paths to files or folders that should be watched for changes. DevSpace uses these paths and the hash values it stores about these paths for evaluating if an image should be rebuilt or if the image building can be skipped because the context of the image has not changed.

:::info
It is highly recommended to specify this option when using `custom` as build tool in order to speed up the build process.

#### Example: Building Images With `custom` Build Command
```yaml
images:
  backend:
    image: john/appbackend
    build:
      custom:
        command: ./build
        args:
        - "--arg1"
        - "--flag"
        - "flag-value"
        - "--arg2"
```
**Explanation:**  
The image `backend` would be built using the command `./build arg1 --flag=flag-value arg2 "[IMAGE]:[TAG]"` while `[IMAGE]` would be replaced with the `image` option (in this case: `john/appbackend`) and `[TAG]` would be replaced with the tag generated according to the [tagging schema](../../configuration/images/basics.mdx#6-tag-image).


### `imageFlag`
The `onChange` option expects a string which states the name of the flag that is used to pass the image name (including auto-generated tag) to the custom build script defined in `command`.

#### Default Value For `imageFlag`
```yaml
imageFlag: "" # Defaults to passing image and tag as an argument instead of using a flag
```

#### Example: Defining `imageFlag` For `custom` Build Command
```yaml
images:
  backend:
    image: john/appbackend
    build:
      custom:
        command: ./build
        imageFlag: image
        args:
        - "--arg1"
        - "--flag"
        - "flag-value"
        - "--arg2"
```
**Explanation:**  
The image `backend` would be built using the command `./build arg1 --flag=flag-value arg2 --image="[IMAGE]:[TAG]"` while `[IMAGE]` would be replaced with the `image` option (in this case: `john/appbackend`) and `[TAG]` would be replaced with the tag generated according to the [tagging schema](../../configuration/images/basics.mdx#6-tag-image).


### `args`
The `args` option expects an array of strings which represent additional flags and arguments that should be passed to the custom build command **before** the argument containing `[IMAGE]:[TAG]`.

#### Default Value For `args`
```yaml
args: []
```

#### Example: Using `args` and `appendArgs` For Custom Builds
```yaml
images:
  backend:
    image: john/appbackend
    build:
      custom:
        command: ./build
        args:
        - "--flag1"
        - "flag-value-1"
        - "arg1"
        - "arg2"
        appendArgs:
        - "arg3"
        - "--flag2"
        - "flag-value-2"
```
**Explanation:**  
The image `backend` would be built using the command `./build --flag1=flag-value-1 arg1 arg2 [IMAGE]:[TAG] arg3 --flag2=flag-value-2` while `[IMAGE]` would be replaced with the `image` option (in this case: `john/appbackend`) and `[TAG]` would be replaced with the tag generated according to the [tagging schema](../../configuration/images/basics.mdx#6-tag-image).


### `appendArgs`
The `appendArgs` option expects an array of strings which represent additional flags and arguments that should be passed to the custom build command **after** the argument containing `[IMAGE]:[TAG]`.

#### Default Value For `appendArgs`
```yaml
appendArgs: []
```

#### Example

### `onChange`
The `onChange` option expects an array of strings which represent paths to files or folders that should be watched for changes. DevSpace uses these paths and the hash values it stores about these paths for evaluating if an image should be rebuilt or if the image building can be skipped because the context of the image has not changed.

#### Default Value For `onChange`
```yaml
onChange: []
```

#### Example: OnChange Option For custom Build Command
```yaml
images:
  backend:
    image: john/appbackend
    build:
      custom:
        command: ./build
        imageFlag: image
        onChange:
        - some/path/
        - another/path/file.txt
```
**Explanation:**  
The image `backend` would be built using the command `./build --image="[IMAGE]:[TAG]"` and DevSpace would skip the build if none of the files within `some/path/` nor the file `another/path/file.txt` has changed since the last build.
