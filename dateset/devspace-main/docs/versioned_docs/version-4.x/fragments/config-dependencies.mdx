    git: https://github.com/my-repo # string    | HTTP(S) URL of the git repository (recommended method for referencing dependencies, must have the format of the git remote repo as usually checked out via git clone)
    subPath: repo/sub/path          # string    | Path within the git repo where devspace.yaml can be found
    branch: master                  # string    | Git branch to checkout

    cloneArgs: []                   # string[]  | Array of args for the "git clone" command for retrieving git based dependencies
    path: ../../my-projects/repo    # string    | Path to a project on your local computer (not recommended, instead of using git-related options)
  profile: default                  # string    | Name of the profile used to deploy this dependency (when multiple profiles are defined in the devspace.yaml of the dependency)
  skipBuild: false                  # bool      | Do not build images of this dependency (= only start deployments)
  ignoreDependencies: false         # bool      | Do not build and deploy dependencies of this dependency
