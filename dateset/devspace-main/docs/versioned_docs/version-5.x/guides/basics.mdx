## Project-Specific Commands

:::note devspace.yaml required
The project-specific commands require that your project is already [initialized](../getting-started/initialize-project.mdx), i.e. there is a `devspace.yaml` config file.
:::


### Start Development
This command deploys the project and then starts the development mode:
```bash
devspace dev
```


### Deploy Project
This command deploys the project to Kubernetes:
```bash
devspace deploy # -p / --profile production     => see: devspace list profiles
```

Run this command to just build, tag and push all images to a registry without deploying the project:
```bash
devspace build
```


### Port Forwarding
To get a list of all ports that are being forwarded as defined in `devspace.yaml`, run:
```bash
devspace list ports
```


### Commands
This command lists all available command:
```bash
devspace list commands
```

Use this command to run one of the custom commands:
```bash
devspace run command [command-name] -- --some-flag --another-flag=value
```


### Profiles
This command lists all available profiles:
```bash
devspace list profiles
```

Use this command to switch to a different profile:
```bash
devspace use profile [optional:profile-name]
```

Use the `-p` flag to just run a single command with a different profile without switching it permanently:
```bash
devspace deploy -p [profile-name]
```

Use this command to print the config after a profile has been applied:
```bash
devspace print -p [profile-name]
```


### Variables
This command lists all variables as well as their values:
```bash
devspace list vars
```

To change the value of a variable, run:
```bash
devspace set var VAR_NAME=value # VAR_NAME_2=value2 VAR_NAME_3=value3
```

Use this command to reset all variables, i.e. delete variable values from the variable cache:
```bash
devspace reset vars
```

Use this command to print the config after all variables have been replaced:
```bash
devspace print
```


### Dependencies
Use this command to update git-based dependencies:
```bash
devspace update dependencies
```
This command performs a `git fetch && git pull` for all git-based dependencies.

Use this command to clear the dependencies cache:
```bash
devspace reset dependencies
```


### Open Project
This command opens the current project in the browser:
```bash
devspace open
```

:::note Must be deployed
This command requires that the project has already been deployed.

## General Purpose Commands

### Open UI
This command opens the localhost development UI:
```bash
devspace ui
```
:::note Development Mode
The localhost development UI starts automatically in the background when running: `devspace dev`
:::


### Stream Logs
This command streams logs of a container:
```bash
devspace logs
```


### Terminal & Commands
This command opens an interactive terminal session for a container:
```bash
devspace enter
```

To run just a single command inside a container, use:
```bash
devspace enter -- my-command --my-flag=my-value ...
```


### File Sync
This command starts an on-demand file synchronization between localhost and a container:
```bash
devspace sync
```

:::note Development Mode
If file sync is configured in your project, it automatically starts when running: `devspace dev`
:::

## Clusters & Namespaces
This command sets a different namespace as default namespace for the current kube-context/cluster:
```bash
devspace use namespace [optional:namespace]
```

:::info Not for Spaces
The command `devspace use namespace` does **<u>not</u>** work for Loft spaces. Use `devspace use space` instead.
:::

This command creates a new space using Loft:
```bash
devspace create space [space-name]
```

This command switches to a different spaces:
```bash
devspace use space [optional:space-name]
```

This command switches to a different kube-context/cluster:
```bash
devspace use context [optional:context-name]
```

## Advanced

### Clean up Images
When using Docker for image building, disk space on your local computer can get sparse after a lot of Docker builds. DevSpace provides a convenient command to clean up all images that were built with your local Docker daemon using DevSpace. This command does not remove any pushed images remotely and just clears local images and space.

In order to clean up all created images locally, simply run the following command in your project folder:
```bash
devspace cleanup images
```

### Clean up Docker
In addition, it also makes sense to prune your Docker environment to free additional space with the following command:

```bash
docker system prune
```

This command will remove:
- all stopped containers
- all networks not used by at least one container
- all dangling images
- all build cache

These commands should free up a lot of space for new image builds to come.
