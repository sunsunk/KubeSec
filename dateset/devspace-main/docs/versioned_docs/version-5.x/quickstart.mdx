This is a 2-minute quickstart guide. For additional details and explanations, see the [Getting Started Guide](./getting-started/installation.mdx).

## 1. Download CLI
<InstallFragment/>

## 2. Choose a Project
You can either deploy one of your own projects or alternatively, checkout one of our demo applications using git:

<ChooseProjectFragment/>

## 3. Initialize Project
```bash
devspace init
```
Choose `Component Chart` and `Based on this existing Dockerfile` for quickstart projects.


## 4. Start Development
```bash
devspace use namespace my-namespace  # will be created by DevSpace if it does not exist
devspace dev
```

As soon as the terminal opens up, you can start your application:

<StartAppFragment/>

**Hot Reloading**: Now, change a file on your local computer and re-run the application inside the container terminal.

**Port Forwarding**: You can access your application via `localhost:PORT` if your port is specified in `dev.ports` within `devspace.yaml`.

When you're done testing development, type `exit` or hit `Ctrl-d` to exit the container terminal.

## 5. Deploy Project
To build your container image and deploy a clean version of this project, run:
```bash
devspace use namespace my-namespace  # will be created by DevSpace if it does not exist
devspace deploy -p production
```

## 6. Cleanup
To purge your deployment from the cluster, run:
```bash
devspace purge
```
