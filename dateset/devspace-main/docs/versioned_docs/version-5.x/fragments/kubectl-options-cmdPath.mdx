The `cmdPath` option expects an array of strings stating additional flags and flag values that should be used when calling `kubectl apply`.

:::warning
Setting `cmdPath` makes it much harder to share your `devspace.yaml` with other team mates. It is recommended to add `kubectl` to your `$PATH` environment variable instead.

#### Example: Setting Path To Kubectl Binary
```yaml
deployments:
- name: backend
  kubectl:
    manifests:
    - backend/
    cmdPath: /path/to/kubectl
```
**Explanation:**  
Deploying the above example would roughly be equivalent to this command:
```bash
/path/to/kubectl apply -f backend/
```
