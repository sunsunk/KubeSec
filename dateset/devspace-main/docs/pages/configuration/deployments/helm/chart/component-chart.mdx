DevSpace provides a built-in general purpose Helm chart that allows you to deploy applications without creating your own Helm chart. The idea of this chart is to be quite generic, so that it is suitable to deploy most applications with it by just customizing the values passed to the chart.

```yaml title=devspace.yaml
version: v2beta1
deployments:
  api:
    helm:
      chart:
        name: component-chart
        repo: https://charts.devspace.sh
      values:
        containers:
          - image: ghcr.io/loft-sh/devspace-example-api
        service:
          ports:
            - port: 8080
```

## Values Reference
The component chart supports the following fields for its `values`:
