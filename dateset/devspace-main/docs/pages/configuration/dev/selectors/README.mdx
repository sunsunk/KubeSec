The first step to turn a regular container deployed to your cluster into a dev container is to tell DevSpace how to find this container inside the cluster. You can achieve this by defining one or multiple selectors.

DevSpace supports the following selectors:
1. [`imageSelector`](./image.mdx) to select based on the image running the container
2. [`labelSelector`](#select-by-pod-labels) to select based on Kubernetes pod labels

Additionally, the following two fields can be used:
- `container` to select one specific container if a pod has multiple containers
- `namespace` to select containers from another namespace

:::tip Logical `&&` For Selectors
If multiple selectors (e.g. `imageSelector` and `labelSelector`) are specified, DevSpace will combine them with a logical AND (`&&`) when looking for a pod/container to match the specified conditions.
