title: Change Resource Constraints For Dev Containers
sidebar_label: Resources

import ConfigPartial from '../../_partials/v2beta1/dev/resources.mdx'

Containers in Kubernetes can request a required amount of infrastructure resources such as CPU and memory. Additionally, containers can also be limited to use no more than a certain threshold of such resources.

To change the infrastructure requests or limits for your dev container, specify the `resources` field.

```yaml title=devspace.yaml
dev:
  backend:
    imageSelector: ghcr.io/org/project/image
    devImage: ghcr.io/loft-sh/devspace-containers/python:3-alpine
    # highlight-start
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: 2Gi
      requests:
        cpu: 0.2
        memory: 512Mi
    # highlight-end
```
