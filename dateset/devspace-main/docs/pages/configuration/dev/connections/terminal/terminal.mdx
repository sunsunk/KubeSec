In the `dev.*.terminal` section in the `devspace.yaml` you can configure the terminal:
```yaml
deployments:
  app:
    helm:
      values:
        containers:
        - image: myregistry/myapp

dev:
  my-dev:
    imageSelector: myregistry/myapp
    terminal: {}
```

## How does it work?

Under the hood DevSpace will replace the running pod and apply the following changes, before actually starting a terminal to it:
- Remove `readinessProbes`, `startupProbes` & `livenessProbes`
- Change the entrypoint of the container to `sleep 100000`
:::info POD REPLACE
If you don't want DevSpace to replace the pod with a modified version, use `disableReplace: true`
:::

:::info SCREEN
DevSpace will also try to install and use [screen](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-linux-screen/) to start the terminal session, as this allows you to reconnect to your existing session after losing connection. You can disable this via the `disableScreen: true` option
