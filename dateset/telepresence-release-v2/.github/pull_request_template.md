 - [ ] I made sure to update `./CHANGELOG.yml`.
 - [ ] I made sure to add any docs changes required for my change (including release notes).
 - [ ] My change is adequately tested.
 - [ ] I updated `DEVELOPING.md` with any special dev tricks I had to use to work on this code efficiently.
 - [ ] I updated `TELEMETRY.md` if I added, changed, or removed a metric name.
 - [ ] Once my PR is ready to have integration tests ran, I posted the PR in #telepresence-dev in the datawire-oss slack so that the "ok to test" label can be applied.
