This file contains all cluster-scoped permissions that the traffic manager needs.
This will be larger if namespaced: false, or smaller if it is true
This will also likely expand over time as we move more things from the clients
domain into the traffic-manager.  But the good news there is that it will
require less permissions in clientRbac.yaml
