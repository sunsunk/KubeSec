docTitle: Telepresence Release Notes
docDescription: >-
  Release notes for Telepresence by Ambassador Labs, a CNCF project
  that enables developers to iterate rapidly on Kubernetes
  microservices by arming them with infinite-scale development
  environments, access to instantaneous feedback loops, and highly
  customizable development environments.
items:
  - version: 2.19.0
    date: (TBD)
    notes:
      - type: change
        title: Tracing is no longer enabled by default.
        body: >-
          Tracing must now be enabled explicitly in order to use the <code>telepresence gather-traces</code>
          command.
      - type: change
        title: Removal of timeouts that are no longer in use
        body: >-
          The <code>config.yml</code> values <code>timeouts.agentInstall</code> and <code>timeouts.apply</code> haven't
          been in use since versions prior to 2.6.0, when the client was responsible for installing the traffic-agent.
          These timeouts are now removed from the code-base, and a warning will be printed when attempts are made to use
          them.
  - version: 2.18.1
    date: (TBD)
    notes:
      - type: feature
        title: Make it possible to specify ignored volume mounts using path prefix.
        body: >-
          Volume mounts like <code>/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io</code> are not declared in the workload. Instead, they
          are injected during pod-creation and their names are generated. It is nwo possible to ignore such mounts using a
          matching path prefix.
      - type: feature
        title: Make the telemount Docker Volume plugin configurable
        body: >-
          A <code>telemount</code> object was added to the <code>intercept</code> object in <code>config.yml</code>
          (or Helm value <code>client.intercept</code>), so that the automatic download and installation of this plugin can
          be fully customised.
      - type: feature
        title: Add option to load the kubeconfig yaml from stdin during connect.
        body: >-
          This allows another process with a kubeconfig already loaded in memory
          to directly pass it to <code>telepresence connect</code> without needing a separate
          file. Simply use a dash "-" as the filename for the <code>--kubeconfig</code> flag.
      - type: bugfix
        title: Get rid of telemount plugin stickiness
        body: >-
          The <code>datawire/telemount</code> that is automatically downloaded and installed, would never be
          updated once the installation was made. Telepresence will now check for the latest release of the
          plugin and cache the result of that check for 24 hours. If a new version arrives, it will be
          installed and used.
      - type: bugfix
        title: Use route instead of address for CIDRs with masks that don't allow "via"
        body: >-
          A CIDR with a mask that leaves less than two bits (/31 or /32 for IPv4)
          cannot be added as an address to the VIF, because such addresses must
          have bits allowing a "via" IP.
          
          The logic was modified to allow such CIDRs to become static routes, using the
          VIF base address as their "via", rather than being VIF addresses in their own right.
      - type: bugfix
        title: Containerized daemon created cache files owned by root
        body: >-
          When using <code>telepresence connect --docker</code> to create a containerized daemon, that
          daemon would sometimes create files in the cache that were owned by root, which then caused
          problems when connecting without the <code>--docker</code> flag.
      - type: bugfix
        title: Remove large number of requests when traffic-manager is used in large clusters.
        body: >-
          The traffic-manager would make a very large number of API requests during cluster start-up
          or when many services were changed for other reasons. The logic that did this was refactored
          and the number of queries were significantly reduced.
      - type: bugfix
        title: Don't patch probes on replaced containers.
        body: >-
          A container that is being replaced by a <code>telepresence intercept --replace</code>
          invocation will have no liveness-, readiness, nor startup-probes. Telepresence didn't
          take this into consideration when injecting the traffic-agent, but now it will refrain
          from patching symbolic port names of those probes.
      - type: bugfix
        title: Don't rely on context name when deciding if a kind cluster is used.
        body: >-
          The code that auto-patches the kubeconfig when connecting to a kind cluster from within
          a docker container, relied on the context name starting with "kind-", but although all
          contexts created by kind have that name, the user is still free to rename it or to create
          other contexts using the same connection properties. The logic was therefore changed
          to instead look for a loopback service address.
  - version: 2.18.0
    date: "2024-2-9"
    notes:
      - type: feature
        title: Include the image for the traffic-agent in the output of the version and status commands.
        body: >-
          The version and status commands will now output the image that the traffic-agent will be using when injected
          by the agent-injector.
      - type: feature
        title: Custom DNS using the client DNS resolver.
        body: >-
          <p>A new <code>telepresence connect --proxy-via CIDR=WORKLOAD</code> flag was introduced, allowing Telepresence
          to translate DNS responses matching specific subnets into virtual IPs that are used locally. Those virtual IPs
          are then routed (with reverse translation) via the pod's of a given workload. This makes it possible to handle
          custom DNS servers that resolve domains into loopback IPs. The flag may also be used in cases where the
          cluster's subnets are in conflict with the workstation's VPN.</p>
          <p>The CIDR can also be a symbolic name that identifies a subnet or list of subnets:<table>
          <tr><td><code>also</code></td><td>All subnets added with --also-proxy</td></tr>
          <tr><td><code>service</code></td><td>The cluster's service subnet</td></tr>
          <tr><td><code>pods</code></td><td>The cluster's pod subnets.</td></tr>
          <tr><td><code>all</code></td><td>All of the above.</td></tr>
          </table></p>
      - type: bugfix
        title: Ensure that agent.appProtocolStrategy is propagated correctly.
        body: >-
          The <code>agent.appProtocolStrategy</code> was inadvertently dropped when moving license related code fromm the
          OSS repository the repository for the Enterprise version of Telepresence. It has now been restored.
      - type: bugfix
        title: Include non-default zero values in output of telepresence config view.
        body: >-
          The <code>telepresence config view</code> command will now print zero values in the output when
          the default for the value is non-zero.
      - type: bugfix
        title: Restore ability to run the telepresence CLI in a docker container.
        body: >-
          The improvements made to be able to run the telepresence daemon in docker
          using <code>telepresence connect --docker</code> made it impossible to run
          both the CLI and the daemon in docker. This commit fixes that and
          also ensures that the user- and root-daemons are merged in this
          scenario when the container runs as root.
      - type: bugfix
        title: Remote mounts when intercepting with the --replace flag.
        body: >-
          A <code>telepresence intercept --replace</code> did not correctly mount all volumes, because when the
          intercepted container was removed, its mounts were no longer visible to the agent-injector when it
          was subjected to a second invocation. The container is now kept in place, but with an image that
          just sleeps infinitely.
      - type: bugfix
        title: Intercepting with the --replace flag will no longer require all subsequent intercepts to use --replace.
        body: >-
          A <code>telepresence intercept --replace</code> will no longer switch the mode of the intercepted workload,
          forcing all subsequent intercepts on that workload to use <code>--replace</code> until the agent is
          uninstalled. Instead, <code>--replace</code> can be used interchangeably just like any other intercept flag.
      - type: bugfix
        title: Kubeconfig exec authentication with context names containing colon didn't work on Windows
        body: >-
          The logic added to allow the root daemon to connect directly to the cluster using the user daemon as a proxy
          for exec type authentication in the kube-config, didn't take into account that a context name sometimes
          contains the colon ":" character. That character cannot be used in filenames on windows because it is the
          drive letter separator.
      - type: bugfix
        title: Provide agent name and tag as separate values in Helm chart
        body: >-
          The <code>AGENT_IMAGE</code> was a concatenation of the agent's name and tag. This is now changed so that the
          env instead contains an <code>AGENT_IMAGE_NAME</code> and <code>AGENT_INAGE_TAG</code>. The <code>AGENT_IMAGE
          </code> is removed. Also, a new env <code>REGISTRY</code> is added, where the registry of the traffic-
          manager image is provided. The <code>AGENT_REGISTRY</code> is no longer required
          and will default to <code>REGISTRY</code> if not set.
      - type: bugfix
        title: Environment interpolation expressions were prefixed twice.
        body: >-
          Telepresence would sometimes prefix environment interpolation expressions in the traffic-agent twice so
          that an expression that looked like <code>$(SOME_NAME)</code> in the app-container, ended up as <code>
          $(_TEL_APP_A__TEL_APP_A_SOME_NAME)</code> in the corresponding expression in the traffic-agent.
      - type: bugfix
        title: Panic in root-daemon on darwin workstations with full access to cluster network.
        body: >-
          A darwin machine with full access to the cluster's subnets will never create a TUN-device, and a check was
          missing if the device actually existed, which caused a panic in the root daemon.
      - type: bugfix
        title: Show allow-conflicting-subnets in telepresence status and telepresence config view.
        body: >-
          The <code>telepresence status</code> and <code>telepresence config view</code> commands didn't show the
          <code>allowConflictingSubnets</code> CIDRs because the value wasn't propagated correctly to the CLI.
      - type: feature
        title: It is now possible use a host-based connection and containerized connections simultaneously.
        body: >-
          Only one host-based connection can exist because that connection will alter the DNS to reflect the namespace
          of the connection. but it's now possible to create additional connections using <code>--docker</code> while
          retaining the host-based connection.
      - type: feature
        title: Ability to set the hostname of a containerized daemon.
        body: >-
          The hostname of a containerized daemon defaults to be the container's ID in Docker. You now can override the
          hostname using <code>telepresence connect --docker --hostname &lt;a name&gt;</code>.
      - type: feature
        title: New <code>--multi-daemon</code>flag to enforce a consistent structure for the status command output.
        body: >-
          The output of the <code>telepresence status</code> when using <code>--output json</code> or <code>--output
          yaml</code> will either show an object where the <code>user_daemon</code> and <code>root_daemon</code>
          are top level elements, or when multiple connections are used, an object where a <code>connections</code>
          list contains objects with those daemons. The flag <code>--multi-daemon</code> will enforce the latter
          structure even when only one daemon is connected so that the output can be parsed consistently. The reason
          for keeping the former structure is to retain backward compatibility with existing parsers.
      - type: bugfix
        title: Make output from telepresence quit more consistent.
        body: >-
          A quit (without -s) just disconnects the host user and root daemons but will quit a container based daemon.
          The message printed was simplified to remove some have/has is/are errors caused by the difference.
      - type: bugfix
        title: "Fix &quot;tls: bad certificate&quot; errors when refreshing the mutator-webhook secret"
        body: >-
          The <code>agent-injector</code> service will now refresh the secret used by the <code>mutator-webhook</code>
          each time a new connection is established, thus preventing the certificates to go out-of-sync when
          the secret is regenerated.
      - type: bugfix
        title: Keep telepresence-agents configmap in sync with pod states.
        body: >-
          An intercept attempt that resulted in a timeout due to failure of injecting the traffic-agent left the
          <code>telepresence-agents</code> configmap in a state that indicated that an agent had been added, which
          caused problems for subsequent intercepts after the problem causing the first failure had been fixed.
      - type: bugfix
        title: The <code>telepresence status</code> command will now report the status of all running daemons.
        body: >-
          A <code>telepresence status</code>, issued when multiple containerized daemons were active, would error with
          &quot;multiple daemons are running, please select one using the --use &lt;match&gt; flag&quot;. This is now
          fixed so that the command instead reports the status of all running daemons.
      - type: bugfix
        title: The <code>telepresence version</code> command will now report the version of all running daemons.
        body: >-
          A <code>telepresence version</code>, issued when multiple containerized daemons were active, would error with
          &quot;multiple daemons are running, please select one using the --use &lt;match&gt; flag&quot;. This is now
          fixed so that the command instead reports the version of all running daemons.
      - type: bugfix
        title: Multiple containerized daemons can now be disconnected using <code>telepresence quit -s</code>
        body: >-
          A <code>telepresence quit -s</code>, issued when multiple containerized daemons were active, would error with
          &quot;multiple daemons are running, please select one using the --use &lt;match&gt; flag&quot;. This is now
          fixed so that the command instead quits all daemons.
      - type: bugfix
        title: The DNS search path on Windows is now restored when Telepresence quits
        body: >-
          The DNS search path that Telepresence uses to simulate the DNS lookup functionality in the connected
          cluster namespace was not removed by a <code>telepresence quit</code>, resulting in connectivity problems
          from the workstation. Telepresence will now remove the entries that it has added to the search list when
          it quits.
      - type: bugfix
        title: The user-daemon would sometimes get killed when used by multiple simultaneous CLI clients.
        body: >-
          The user-daemon would die with a fatal &quot;fatal error: concurrent map writes&quot; error in the
          <code>connector.log</code>, effectively killing the ongoing connection.
      - type: bugfix
        title: Multiple services ports using the same target port would not get intercepted correctly.
        body: >-
          Intercepts didn't work when multiple service ports were using the same container port. Telepresence would
          think that one of the ports wasn't intercepted and therefore disable the intercept of the container port.
      - type: bugfix
        title: Root daemon refuses to disconnect.
        body: >-
          The root daemon would sometimes hang forever when attempting to disconnect due to a deadlock in
          the VIF-device.
      - type: bugfix
        title: Fix panic in user daemon when traffic-manager was unreachable
        body: >-
          The user daemon would panic if the traffic-manager was unreachable. It will now instead report
          a proper error to the client.
      - type: change
        title: Removal of backward support for versions predating 2.6.0
        body: >-
          The telepresence helm installer will no longer discover and convert workloads that were modified by versions
          prior to 2.6.0. The traffic manager will and no longer support the muxed tunnels used in versions prior to
          2.5.0.
  - version: 2.17.0
    date: "2023-11-14"
    notes:
      - type: feature
        title: Additional Prometheus metrics to track intercept/connect activity
        body: >-
          This feature adds the following metrics to the Prometheus endpoint: <code>connect_count</code>, 
          <code>connect_active_status</code>, <code>intercept_count</code>, and <code>intercept_active_status</code. 
          These are labeled by client/install_id. 
          Additionally, the <code>intercept_count</code> metric has been renamed to <code>active_intercept_count</code> 
          for clarity.
      - type: feature
        title: Make the Telepresence client docker image configurable.
        body: >-
          The docker image used when running a Telepresence intercept in docker mode can now be configured using
          the setting <code>images.clientImage</code> and will default first to the value of the environment <code>
          TELEPRESENCE_CLIENT_IMAGE</code>, and then to the value preset by the telepresence binary. This
          configuration setting is primarily intended for testing purposes.
      - type: feature
        title: Use traffic-agent port-forwards for outbound and intercepted traffic.
        body: >-
          The telepresence TUN-device is now capable of establishing direct port-forwards to a traffic-agent in the
          connected namespace. That port-forward is then used for all outbound traffic to the device, and also for
          all traffic that arrives from intercepted workloads. Getting rid of the extra hop via the traffic-manager
          improves performance and reduces the load on the traffic-manager. The feature can only be used if the client
          has Kubernetes port-forward permissions to the connected namespace. It can be disabled by setting <code>
          cluster.agentPortForward</code> to <code>false</code> in <code>config.yml</code>.
      - type: feature
        title: Improve outbound traffic performance.
        body: >-
          The root-daemon now communicates directly with the traffic-manager instead of routing all outbound traffic
          through the user-daemon. The root-daemon uses a patched kubeconfig where <code>exec</code> configurations to
          obtain credentials are dispatched to the user-daemon. This to ensure that all authentication plugins will
          execute in user-space. The old behavior of routing everything through the user-daemon can be restored by
          setting <code>cluster.connectFromRootDaemon</code> to <code>false</code> in <code>config.yml</code>.
      - type: feature
        title: New networking CLI flag --allow-conflicting-subnets
        body: >-
          telepresence connect (and other commands that kick off a connect) now accepts an --allow-conflicting-subnets
          CLI flag. This is equivalent to client.routing.allowConflictingSubnets in the helm chart, but can be specified
          at connect time. It will be appended to any configuration pushed from the traffic manager.
      - type: change
        title: Warn if large version mismatch between traffic manager and client.
        body: >-
          Print a warning if the minor version diff between the client and the traffic manager is greater than three.
      - type: change
        title: The authenticator binary was removed from the docker image.
        body: >-
          The <code>authenticator</code> binary, used when serving proxied <code>exec</code> kubeconfig credential
          retrieval, has been removed. The functionality was instead added as a subcommand to the <code>telepresence
          </code> binary.

      - type: feature
        title: Add --docker-debug flag to the telepresence intercept command.
        body: >-
          This flag is similar to <code>--docker-build</code> but will start the container with more relaxed security
          using the <code>docker run</code> flags <code>--security-opt apparmor=unconfined --cap-add SYS_PTRACE</code>.
      - type: feature
        title: Add a --export option to the telepresence connect command.
        body: >-
          In some situations it is necessary to make some ports available to the
          host from a containerized telepresence daemon. This commit adds a
          repeatable <code>--expose &lt;docker port exposure&gt;</code> flag to the connect
          command.
      - type: feature
        title: Prevent agent-injector webhook from selecting from kube-xxx namespaces.
        body: >-
          The <code>kube-system</code> and <code>kube-node-lease</code> namespaces should not be affected by a
          global agent-injector webhook by default. A default <code>namespaceSelector</code> was therefore added
          to the Helm Chart <code>agentInjector.webhook</code> that contains a <code>NotIn</code> preventing those
          namespaces from being selected.
      - type: bugfix
        title: Backward compatibility for pod template TLS annotations.
        body: >-
          Users of Telepresence < 2.9.0 that make use of the pod template TLS annotations were unable to upgrade because
          the annotation names have changed (now prefixed by "telepresence."), and the environment expansion of the
          annotation values was dropped. This fix restores support for the old names (while retaining the new ones) and
          the environment expansion.
      - type: security
        title: Built with go 1.21.3
        body: >-
          Built Telepresence with go 1.21.3 to address CVEs.
      - type: bugfix
        title: Match service selector against pod template labels
        body: >-
          When listing intercepts (typically by calling <code>telepresence list</code>) selectors of services are matched
          against workloads. Previously the match was made against the labels of the workload, but now they are matched
          against the labels pod template of the workload. Since the service would actually be matched against pods this
          is more correct. The most common case when this makes a difference is that statefulsets now are listed when they should.

      - type: bugfix
        title: The helm sub-commands will no longer start the user daemon.
        body: >-
          The <code>telepresence helm install/upgrade/uninstall</code> commands will no longer start the telepresence
          user daemon because there's no need to connect to the traffic-manager in order for them to execute.
      - type: bugfix
        title: Routing table race condition
        body: >-
          A race condition would sometimes occur when a Telepresence TUN device was deleted and another created in rapid
          succession that caused the routing table to reference interfaces that no longer existed.
      - type: bugfix
        title: Stop lingering daemon container
        body: >-
          When using <code>telepresence connect --docker</code>, a lingering container could be present, causing errors
          like &quot;The container name NN is already in use by container XX ...&quot;. When this happens, the connect
          logic will now give the container some time to stop and then call <code>docker stop NN</code> to stop it
          before retrying to start it.
      - type: bugfix
        title: Add file locking to the Telepresence cache
        body: >-
          Files in the Telepresence cache are accesses by multiple processes. The processes will now use advisory
          locks on the files to guarantee consistency.
      - type: change
        title: Lock connection to namespace
        body: >-
          The behavior changed so that a connected Telepresence client is bound to a namespace. The namespace can then
          not be changed unless the client disconnects and reconnects. A connection is also given a name. The default
          name is composed from <code>&lt;kube context name&gt;-&lt;namespace&gt;</code> but can be given explicitly
          when connecting using <code>--name</code>. The connection can optionally be identified using the option
          <code>--use &lt;name match&gt;</code> (only needed when docker is used and more than one connection is active).
      - type: change
        title: Deprecation of global --context and --docker flags.
        body: >-
          The global flags <code>--context</code> and <code>--docker</code> will now be considered deprecated unless used
          with commands that accept the full set of Kubernetes flags (e.g. <code>telepresence connect</code>).
      - type: change
        title: Deprecation of the --namespace flag for the intercept command.
        body: >-
          The <code>--namespace</code> flag is now deprecated for <code>telepresence intercept</code> command. The flag can instead
          be used with all commands that accept the full set of Kubernetes flags (e.g. <code>telepresence connect</code>).
      - type: change
        title: Legacy code predating version 2.6.0 was removed.
        body: >-
          The telepresence code-base still contained a lot of code that would modify workloads instead of relying on
          the mutating webhook installer when a traffic-manager version predating version 2.6.0 was discovered. This
          code has now been removed.
      - type: feature
        title: Add `telepresence list-namespaces` and `telepresence list-contexts` commands
        body: >-
          These commands can be used to check accessible namespaces and for automation.
      - type: change
        title: Implicit connect warning
        body: >-
          A deprecation warning will be printed if a command other than <code>telepresence connect</code> causes an
          implicit connect to happen. Implicit connects will be removed in a future release.

        title: KUBECONFIG env var can now be used with the docker mode.
        body: >-
          If provided, the KUBECONFIG environment variable was passed to the kubeauth-foreground service as a parameter.
          However, since it didn't exist, the CLI was throwing an error when using <code>telepresence connect --docker</code>.

        body: >-
          The <code>telepresence list --output json-stream</code> wasn't releasing the session's lock after being
          stopped, including with a <code>telepresence quit</code>. The user could be blocked as a result.

        title: Envoy's http idle timout is now configurable.
        body: >-
          A new <code>agent.helm.httpIdleTimeout</code> setting was added to the Helm chart that controls
          the proprietary Traffic agent's http idle timeout. The default of one hour, which in some situations
          would cause a lot of resource consuming and lingering connections, was changed to 70 seconds.

        title: DNS configuration now supports excludes and mappings.
        body: >-
          The DNS configuration now supports two new fields, excludes and mappings. The excludes field allows you to
          exclude a given list of hostnames from resolution, while the mappings field can be used to resolve a hostname with
          another.

        title: Fixed traffic-agent backward incompatibility issue causing lack of remote mounts
        body: >-
          A traffic-agent of version 2.13.3 (or 1.13.15) would not propagate the directories under
          <code>/var/run/secrets</code> when used with a traffic manager older than 2.13.3.

        title: Fixed race condition causing segfaults on rare occasions when a tunnel stream timed out.
        body: >-
          A context cancellation could sometimes be trapped in a stream reader, causing it to incorrectly return
          an undefined message which in turn caused the parent reader to panic on a <code>nil</code> pointer reference.
