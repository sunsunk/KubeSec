### ManagedCluster Scenarios

[ManagedCluster](https://open-cluster-management.io/concepts/managedcluster/) scenarios provide a way to integrate kraken with [Open Cluster Management (OCM)](https://open-cluster-management.io/) and [Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes (ACM)](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/advanced-cluster-management).

ManagedCluster scenarios leverage [ManifestWorks](https://open-cluster-management.io/concepts/manifestwork/) to inject faults into the ManagedClusters.

The following ManagedCluster chaos scenarios are supported:

1. **managedcluster_start_scenario**: Scenario to start the ManagedCluster instance.
2. **managedcluster_stop_scenario**: Scenario to stop the ManagedCluster instance.
3. **managedcluster_stop_start_scenario**: Scenario to stop and then start the ManagedCluster instance.
4. **start_klusterlet_scenario**: Scenario to start the klusterlet of the ManagedCluster instance.
5. **stop_klusterlet_scenario**: Scenario to stop the klusterlet of the ManagedCluster instance.
6. **stop_start_klusterlet_scenario**: Scenario to stop and start the klusterlet of the ManagedCluster instance.

ManagedCluster scenarios can be injected by placing the ManagedCluster scenarios config files under `managedcluster_scenarios` option in the Kraken config. Refer to [managedcluster_scenarios_example](https://github.com/redhat-chaos/krkn/blob/main/scenarios/kube/managedcluster_scenarios_example.yml) config file.

                                                                    # (default leaseDurationSeconds = 60 sec)
