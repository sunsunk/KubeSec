# Governance

The governance model adopted in KubeDL is influenced by many CNCF projects.

## Principles

- **Open**: KubeDL is open source community.
- **Welcoming and respectful**: See [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).
- **Transparent and accessible**: Work and collaboration should be done in public.
- **Merit**: Ideas and contributions are accepted according to their technical merit
  and alignment with project objectives, scope and design principles.

## Project Maintainers

* Classify GitHub issues and perform pull request reviews for other maintainers and the community.

* Maintainers are expected to respond to assigned Pull Requests in a reasonable time frame.

* Participate when called upon in the security release process. Note
  that although this should be a rare occurrence, if a serious vulnerability is found, the process
  may take up to several full days of work to implement.

## Process of becoming a maintainer

* We will expect you to have completed a reasonable amount of contributions in code, documentations etc.

* We will expect you to review other contributors' PRs in your area of expertise.

* We will expect you to have a good understanding about the project, and share responsibilities in maintaining the projects.

* Finally, talk to one of the existing project [maintainers](OWNERS) to show your interest in becoming a maintainer.

## When does a maintainer lose maintainer status

* The KubeDL community will never forcefully remove a current Maintainer, unless a maintainer fails to meet 
  the principles of KubeDL community.

## Decision making process

Decisions are made based on consensus between maintainers. In extreme cases, a simple majority voting process is invoked 
where each maintainer receives one vote.

Proposals and ideas can either be submitted for agreement via a github issue or PR.

In general, we prefer that technical issues and maintainer membership are amicably worked out between the persons involved.
If a dispute cannot be decided independently, get a third-party maintainer (e.g. a mutual contact with some background
on the issue, but not involved in the conflict) to intercede and the final decision will be made.
Decision making process should be transparent to adhere to the principles of KubeDL project.

## Code of Conduct

The KubeDL [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) is aligned with the CNCF Code of Conduct.
