Roadmap
=======

_Note: Previous roadmaps can be found with the roadmap reviews for that period.

When we first began writing roadmaps for the in-toto project, the reference
implementation was still maturing, and we found it valuable to plan and record
its progress independently of the in-toto specification. Today, the reference
implementation has reached stability, and closely matches the current version
of the specification. As a result, our plans for the future of in-toto no
longer affect the implementation or specification alone, but the full project
as a whole. Therefore, starting with the 2022 period, please refer to the
organization's roadmap for progress reports of the implementation.
