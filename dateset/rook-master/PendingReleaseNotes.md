# v1.14 Pending Release Notes

## Breaking Changes

- The removal of `CSI_ENABLE_READ_AFFINITY` option and its replacement with per-cluster
read affinity setting in cephCluster CR (CSIDriverOptions section) in [PR](https://github.com/rook/rook/pull/13665)
- updating `netNamespaceFilePath` for all clusterIDs in rook-ceph-csi-config configMap in [PR](https://github.com/rook/rook/pull/13613)
  - Issue: The netNamespaceFilePath isn't updated in the CSI config map for all the clusterIDs when `CSI_ENABLE_HOST_NETWORK` is set to false in `operator.yaml`
  - Impact: This results in the unintended network configurations, with pods using the host networking instead of pod networking.
- Rook is beginning the process of deprecating holder pods. This is especially important for Multus
  users. Helm chart users should take care to set the new config `disableHolderPods: false` if they
  are using Multus and still using the `rook-ceph` chart's default `values.yaml`. Special upgrade
  docs for multus can be found [here](Documentation/CRDs/Cluster/network-providers.md#migrating-to-remove-multus-holder-pods).
