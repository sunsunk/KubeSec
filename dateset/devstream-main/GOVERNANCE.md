# Project Governance

## Values

DevStream and its leadership embrace the following values:

- Inclusivity: We innovate through different perspectives and skill sets, which can only be accomplished in a welcoming and respectful environment.

- Insist on the Highest Standards: Contributors have relentlessly high standards — many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Contributors are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Contributors ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.

- Ownership: Contributors are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire community, beyond just their own. They never say "that’s not my job."

- Participation: Responsibilities within the project are earned through participation, and there is a clear path up the contributor ladder into leadership positions.

- Community over Product or Company: Sustaining and growing our community takes priority over shipping code or sponsors' organizational goals. Each contributor participates in the project as an individual.

- Openness: Communication and decision-making happen in the open and is discoverable for future reference as much as possible. All discussions and work take place in public Slack channels and open repositories.

- Fairness: All stakeholders have the opportunity to provide feedback and submit contributions, which will be considered on their merits.

## Maintainers

DevStream Maintainers have write access to the [DevStream GitHub repository](https://github.com/devstream-io/devstream). They can merge their patches or patches from others. The current maintainers can be found in [CODEOWNERS](./CODEOWNERS). Maintainers collectively manage the project's resources and contributors.

This privilege is granted with some expectation of responsibility: maintainers are people who care about the DevStream project and want to help it grow and improve. A maintainer is not just someone who can make changes, but someone who has demonstrated their ability to collaborate with the team, get the most knowledgeable people to review code and docs, contribute high-quality code, and follow through to fix issues (in code or tests).

A maintainer is a contributor to the project's success and a citizen helping the project succeed.

## Becoming a Maintainer

See [here](https://docs.devstream.io/en/latest/contributor_ladder/#maintainer).

## Meetings

Time zones permitting, Maintainers are expected to participate in the public developer meeting, which is published [here](https://github.com/devstream-io/devstream/wiki).

Maintainers will also have closed meetings to discuss security reports or Code of Conduct violations.  Such meetings should be scheduled by any Maintainer on receipt of a security issue or CoC report. All current Maintainers must be invited to such closed meetings, except for any Maintainer who is accused of a CoC violation.

## CNCF Resources

Any Maintainer may suggest a request for CNCF resources during a meeting. A simple majority of Maintainers approve the request.  The Maintainers may also choose to delegate working with the CNCF to non-Maintainer community members.

## Code of Conduct

[Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) violations by community members will be discussed and resolved during the private maintainer meeting. If the reported CoC violator is a Maintainer, the Maintainers will instead designate two Maintainers to work with CNCF staff in resolving the report.

## Voting

While most business in DevStream is conducted by "lazy consensus", periodically the Maintainers may need to vote on specific actions or changes. A vote can be taken during a community meeting or a private maintainer meeting for security or conduct matters. Any Maintainer may
demand a vote be taken.

Most votes require a simple majority of all Maintainers to succeed. Maintainers can be removed by a 2/3 majority vote of all Maintainers, and changes to this Governance require a 2/3 vote of all Maintainers.
