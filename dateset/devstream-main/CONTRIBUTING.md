# Contributing

Welcome to DevStream!

Thanks for contributing, and thanks for reading this doc before doing it!

The [DevStream Docs website](https://docs.devstream.io) contains information about how to get started, how the community organizes, and more. See the followings for more details before you decide to contribute:

- [Contributing Guide](https://docs.devstream.io/en/latest/contributing_guide/).
- [Development Workflow](https://docs.devstream.io/en/latest/development/git-workflow/git-workflow/), and other docs under the "Developer Guide" section.

Those guidelines, as the name suggests, are only guidelines, not rules. So, use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to the contribute/development docs.
