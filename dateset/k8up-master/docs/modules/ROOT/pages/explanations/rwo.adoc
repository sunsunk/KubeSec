= How RWO Backups are implemented

K8s does not prevent mounting a RWO PVC to multiple pods, if they are scheduled on the same host.
K8up uses this fact to provide the ability to back up RWO PVCs.

For a given backup in a namespace K8up will list all the PVCs.
The PVCs are then grouped depending on their type:

* all RWX PVCs are grouped together
* RWO PVCs are grouped by k8s node where they are currently mounted

K8up will then deploy backup jobs according to the grouping, a single job for all RWX PVCs and a job for each K8s node.
The jobs themselves work as before, they loop over the mounted PVCs and do a file backup via restic.
