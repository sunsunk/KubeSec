= How to Create a Backup

The `Backup` object defines what and how to backup:

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$tutorial/backup.yaml[]
----

Save the YAML above in a file named `backup.yaml` and use the `kubectl apply -f backup.yaml` command to deploy this configuration to your cluster.

TIP: To have backups run automatically at a regular interval look at xref:how-tos/schedules.adoc[schedules].

TIP: By default, all PVCs are backed up automatically. Adding the annotation `k8up.io/backup=false` to a PVC object will exclude it from all following backups. Alternatively, you can set the environment variable `BACKUP_SKIP_WITHOUT_ANNOTATION=true` if you want K8up to ignore objects without the annotation.
