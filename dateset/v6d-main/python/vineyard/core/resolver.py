    the global environment.

    The :code:`resolver_context` can be useful when users have more than
    more resolver for a certain type, e.g., the :code:`vineyard::Tensor`
    object can be resolved as :code:`numpy.ndarray` or :code:`xgboost::DMatrix`.

    We could have

    .. code:: python

        def numpy_resolver(obj):
            ...

        default_resolver_context.register('vineyard::Tensor', numpy_resolver)

    and

    .. code:: python

        def xgboost_resolver(obj):
            ...

        default_resolver_context.register('vineyard::Tensor', xgboost_resolver)

    Obviously there's a conflict, and the stackable :code:`resolver_context` could
    help there,

    .. code:: python

        with resolver_context({'vineyard::Tensor', xgboost_resolver}):
            ...

    Assuming the default context resolves :code:`vineyard::Tensor` to
    :code:`numpy.ndarray`, inside the :code:`with resolver_context` the
    :code:`vineyard::Tensor` will be resolved to :code:`xgboost::DMatrix`,
    and after exiting the context the global environment will be restored
    back as default.

    The :code:`with resolver_context` is nestable as well.
