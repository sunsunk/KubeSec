# Authenticating to Ironic

Because hosts under the control of MetalÂ³ need to contact the Ironic
API during inspection and provisioning, it is highly advisable to
require authentication on this API, since the provisioned hosts running user
workloads will remain connected to the provisioning network.

## Configuration

The `baremetal-operator` supports connecting to Ironic configured with the
following `auth_strategy` modes:

* `noauth` (no authentication)
* `http_basic` (HTTP [Basic access authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication))

Note that Keystone authentication methods are not yet supported.

Authentication configuration is read from the filesystem, beginning at the root
directory specified in the environment variable `METAL3_AUTH_ROOT_DIR`. If this
variable is empty or not specified, the default is `/opt/metal3/auth`.

Within the root directory there is a separate subdirectory `ironic` for
Ironic client configuration.

### `noauth`

This is the default, and will be chosen if the auth root directory does not
exist. In this mode, the baremetal-operator does not attempt to do any
authentication against the Ironic APIs.

### `http_basic`

This mode is configured by files in each authentication subdirectory named
`username` and `password`, and containing the Basic auth username and password,
respectively.
