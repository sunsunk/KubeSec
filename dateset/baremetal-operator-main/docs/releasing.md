# baremetal-operator releasing

This document details the steps to create a release for `baremetal-operator` aka
BMO.

**NOTE**: Always follow
[release documentation from the main branch](https://github.com/metal3-io/baremetal-operator/blob/main/docs/releasing.md).
Release documentation in release branches may be outdated.

**NOTE**: release branches are not in use yet, tags are done directly on the
main branch.

## Before making a release

Things you should check before making a release:

- Check the
  [Metal3 release process](https://github.com/metal3-io/metal3-docs/blob/main/processes/releasing.md)
  for high-level process and possible follow-up actions
- Verify controller Go modules use latest corresponding CAPI modules
- Verify any other direct or indirect dependency is uplifted to close any public
  vulnerabilities

## Permissions

Creating a release requires repository `write` permissions for:

- Tag pushing
- Branch creation
- GitHub Release publishing

These permissions are implicit for the org admins and repository admins. Release
team member gets his/her permissions via `metal3-release-team` membership. This
GitHub team has the required permissions in each repository required to release
BMO. Adding person to the team gives him/her the necessary rights in all
relevant repositories in the organization. Individual persons should not be
given permissions directly.

## Process

BMO uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org). For version `v0.x.y`:

### Repository setup

Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:metal3-io/baremetal-operator`

or if using existing repository, verify your intended remote is set to
`metal3-io`: `git remote -v`. For this document, we assume it is `origin`.

- If creating a new minor branch, identify the commit you wish to create the
  branch from, and create a branch `release-0.x`:
  `git checkout <sha> -b release-0.x` and push it to remote:
  `git push origin release-0.x` to create it
- If creating a new patch release, use existing branch `release-0.x`:
  `git checkout origin/release-0.x`

### Tags

First we create a primary release tag, that triggers release note creation and
image building processes.

- Create a signed, annotated tag with: `git tag -s -a v0.x.y -m v0.x.y`
- Push the tags to the GitHub repository: `git push origin v0.x.y`

This triggers two things:

- GitHub action workflow for automated release process creates a draft release
  in GitHub repository with correct content, comparing the pushed tag to
  previous tag. Running actions are visible on the
  [Actions](https://github.com/metal3-io/baremetal-operator/actions) page, and
  draft release will be visible on top of the
  [Releases](https://github.com/metal3-io/baremetal-operator/releases) page.
- Quay starts building release image with the release tag. Make sure the release
  is built successfully in
  [Quay builds page](https://quay.io/repository/metal3-io/baremetal-operator?tab=builds).
  If the release tag build is not visible, check if the build trigger is
  enabled. Quay disables build trigger sometimes when build has failed few
  times.

We also need to create one or more tags for the Go modules ecosystem:

- For any subdirectory with `go.mod` in it (excluding `hack/tools`), create
  another Git tag with directory prefix, ie. `git tag apis/v0.x.y`,
  `git tag test/v0.x.y` and `git tag pkg/hardwareutils/v0.x.y`. This enables the
  tags to be used as a Gomodule version for any downstream users. **NOTE**: Do
  not create annotated tags (`-a`, or implicitly via `-m` or `-s`) for Go
  modules. Release notes expects only the main tag to be annotated, otherwise it
  might create incorrect release notes.

### Release artifacts

We need to verify all release artifacts are correctly built or generated by the
release workflow. For a release, we should have the following artifacts:

Git tags pushed:

- Primary release tag: `v0.x.y`
- Go module tags: `apis/v0.x.y`, `test/v0.x.y` and `pkg/hardwareutils/v0.x.y`

Container images built and tagged at Quay registry:

- [baremetal-operator:v0.x.y](https://quay.io/repository/metal3-io/baremetal-operator?tab=tags)
- [keepalived:v0.x.y](https://quay.io/repository/metal3-io/keepalived?tab=tags)

Files included in the release page:

- Source code

### Release notes

Next step is to clean up the release note manually.

- Check for duplicates, reverts, and incorrect classifications of PRs, and
  whatever release creation tagged to be manually checked.
- For any superseded PRs (like same dependency uplifted multiple times, or
  commit revertions) that provide no value to the release, move them to
  Superseded section. This way the changes are acknowledged to be part of the
  release, but not overwhelming the important changes contained by the release.
- If the release you're making is not a new major release, new minor release, or
  a new patch release from the latest release branch, uncheck the box for latest
  release.
- If it is a release candidate (RC) or a pre-release, tick pre-release box.
- Publish the release.

## Post-release actions for new release branches

Some post-release actions are needed if new minor or major branch was created.

### Branch protection rules

Branch protection rules need to be applied to the new release branch. Copy the
settings after the previous release branch, with the exception of
`Required tests` selection. Required tests can only be selected after new
keywords are implemented in Jenkins JJB, and project-infra, and have been run at
least once in the PR targeting the branch in question. Branch protection rules
require user to have `admin` permissions in the repository.

### Update README.md and build badges

Update `README.md` with release specific information, both on `main` and in the
new `release-0.x` branch as necessary.

[Prior art](https://github.com/metal3-io/baremetal-operator/pull/1517)

In the `release-0.x` branch, update the build badges in the `README.md` to point
to correct Jenkins jobs, so the build statuses of the release branch are
visible.

## Additional actions outside this repository

Further additional actions are required in the Metal3 project after BMO release.
For that, please continue following the instructions provided in
[Metal3 release process](https://github.com/metal3-io/metal3-docs/blob/main/processes/releasing.md)
