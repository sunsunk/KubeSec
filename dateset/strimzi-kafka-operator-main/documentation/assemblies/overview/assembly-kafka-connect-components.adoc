= About Kafka Connect

[role="_abstract"]
Kafka Connect is an integration toolkit for streaming data between Kafka brokers and other systems.
The other system is typically an external data source or target, such as a database.

include::../../shared/snip-intro-connectors.adoc[]

Strimzi operates Kafka Connect in _distributed mode_, distributing data streaming tasks across one or more worker pods.
A Kafka Connect cluster comprises a group of worker pods.
Each connector is instantiated on a single worker.
Each connector comprises one or more tasks that are distributed across the group of workers.
Distribution across workers permits highly scalable pipelines.

Workers convert data from one format into another format that's suitable for the source or target system.
Depending on the configuration of the connector instance, workers might also apply transforms (also known as Single Message Transforms, or SMTs).
Transforms adjust messages, such as filtering certain data, before they are converted.
Kafka Connect has some built-in transforms, but other transformations can be provided by plugins if necessary.
