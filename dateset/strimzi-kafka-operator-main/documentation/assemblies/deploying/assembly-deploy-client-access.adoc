= Setting up client access to a Kafka cluster

[role="_abstract"]
After you have xref:deploy-tasks_{context}[deployed Strimzi], you can set up client access to your Kafka cluster.
To verify the deployment, you can deploy example producer and consumer clients.
Otherwise, create listeners that provide client access within or outside the Kubernetes cluster.
