= Finding information on Kafka restarts

[role="_abstract"]
After the Cluster Operator restarts a Kafka pod in a Kubernetes cluster, it emits a Kubernetes event into the pod's namespace explaining why the pod restarted.
For help in understanding cluster behavior, you can check restart events from the command line.

TIP: You can export and monitor restart events using metrics collection tools like Prometheus. Use the metrics tool with an _event exporter_ that can export the output in a suitable format.
