Take the necessary preparatory steps according to your specific requirements, such as the following:

* xref:deploy-prereqs-{context}[Ensuring you have the necessary prerequisites before deploying Strimzi]
* xref:downloads-{context}[Downloading the Strimzi release artifacts to facilitate your deployment]
