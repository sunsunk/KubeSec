= Deploying the Cluster Operator

[role="_abstract"]
The Cluster Operator is responsible for deploying and managing Kafka clusters within a Kubernetes cluster.

When the Cluster Operator is running, it starts to watch for updates of Kafka resources.

By default, a single replica of the Cluster Operator is deployed. 
You can add replicas with leader election so that additional Cluster Operators are on standby in case of disruption. 
For more information, see xref:assembly-using-multiple-cluster-operator-replicas-str[].
