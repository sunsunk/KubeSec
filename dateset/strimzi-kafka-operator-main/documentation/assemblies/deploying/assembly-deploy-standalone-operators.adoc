[id="deploy-standalone-operators_{context}"]
= Alternative standalone deployment options for Strimzi operators

[role="_abstract"]
You can perform a standalone deployment of the Topic Operator and User Operator.
Consider a standalone deployment of these operators if you are using a Kafka cluster that is not managed by the Cluster Operator.

You deploy the operators to Kubernetes.
Kafka can be running outside of Kubernetes.
For example, you might be using a Kafka as a managed service.
You adjust the deployment configuration for the standalone operator to match the address of your Kafka cluster.
