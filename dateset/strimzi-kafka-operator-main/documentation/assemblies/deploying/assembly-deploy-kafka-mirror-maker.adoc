= Deploying Kafka MirrorMaker

[role="_abstract"]
Kafka MirrorMaker replicates data between two or more Kafka clusters, within or across data centers.
This process is called mirroring to avoid confusion with the concept of Kafka partition replication.
MirrorMaker consumes messages from a source cluster and republishes those messages to a target cluster.

Data replication across clusters supports scenarios that require the following:

* Recovery of data in the event of a system failure
* Consolidation of data from multiple source clusters for centralized analysis
* Restriction of data access to a specific cluster
* Provision of data at a specific location to improve latency
