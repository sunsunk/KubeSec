= Using the Topic Operator to manage Kafka topics

[role="_abstract"]
The `KafkaTopic` resource configures topics, including partition and replication factor settings. 
When you create, modify, or delete a topic using `KafkaTopic`, the Topic Operator ensures that these changes are reflected in the Kafka cluster.

For more information on the `KafkaTopic` resource, see the link:{BookURLConfiguring}#type-KafkaTopic-reference[`KafkaTopic` schema reference^].
