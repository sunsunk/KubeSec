= Recovering a cluster from persistent volumes

You can recover a Kafka cluster from persistent volumes (PVs) if they are still present.

You might want to do this, for example, after:

* A namespace was deleted unintentionally
* A whole Kubernetes cluster is lost, but the PVs remain in the infrastructure
