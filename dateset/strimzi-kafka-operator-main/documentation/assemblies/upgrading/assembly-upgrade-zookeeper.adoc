= Upgrading Kafka when using ZooKeeper

[role="_abstract"]
If you are using a ZooKeeper-based Kafka cluster, an upgrade requires an update to the Kafka version and the inter-broker protocol version.

If you want to switch a Kafka cluster from using ZooKeeper for metadata management to operating in KRaft mode, the steps must be performed separately from the upgrade. 
For information on migrating to a KRaft-based cluster, see xref:proc-deploy-migrate-kraft-str[].
