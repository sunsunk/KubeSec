The URL has to include the policy which will be queried by the authorizer.

Defaults to `false` - all actions will be denied.

= `initialCacheCapacity`
Initial capacity of the local cache used by the authorizer to avoid querying the Open Policy Agent for every request.
Defaults to `5000`.

= `maximumCacheSize`
Maximum capacity of the local cache used by the authorizer to avoid querying the Open Policy Agent for every request.
Defaults to `50000`.

= `expireAfterMs`
The expiration of the records kept in the local cache to avoid querying the Open Policy Agent for every request.
Defines how often the cached authorization decisions are reloaded from the Open Policy Agent server.
