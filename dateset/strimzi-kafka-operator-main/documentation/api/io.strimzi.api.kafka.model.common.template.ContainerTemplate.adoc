You can set custom security context and environment variables for a container.

The environment variables are defined under the `env` property as a list of objects with `name` and `value` fields.
The following example shows two custom environment variables and a custom security context set for the Kafka broker containers:

[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
# ...
template:
  kafkaContainer:
    env:
    - name: EXAMPLE_ENV_1
      value: example.env.one
    - name: EXAMPLE_ENV_2
      value: example.env.two
    securityContext:
      runAsUser: 2000
# ...
----

Environment variables prefixed with `KAFKA_` are internal to Strimzi and should be avoided.
If you set a custom environment variable that is already in use by Strimzi, it is ignored and a warning is recorded in the log.
