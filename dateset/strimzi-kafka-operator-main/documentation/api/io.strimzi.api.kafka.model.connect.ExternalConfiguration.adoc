Configures external storage properties that define configuration options for Kafka Connect connectors.

You can mount ConfigMaps or Secrets into a Kafka Connect pod as environment variables or volumes.
Volumes and environment variables are configured in the `externalConfiguration` property in `KafkaConnect.spec` or `KafkaMirrorMaker2.spec`.

When applied, the environment variables and volumes are available for use when developing your connectors.
