= `cors`

As well as enabling HTTP access to a Kafka cluster, HTTP properties provide the capability to enable and define access control for the Kafka Bridge through Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).
CORS is a HTTP mechanism that allows browser access to selected resources from more than one origin.
To configure CORS, you define a list of allowed resource origins and HTTP access methods.
For the origins, you can use a URL or a Java regular expression.
