`Labels` and `Annotations` are used to identify and organize resources, and are configured in the `metadata` property.

For example:

[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
# ...
template:
  pod:
    metadata:
      labels:
        label1: value1
        label2: value2
      annotations:
        annotation1: value1
        annotation2: value2
# ...
----

The `labels` and `annotations` fields can contain any labels or annotations that do not contain the reserved string `strimzi.io`.
Labels and annotations containing `strimzi.io` are used internally by Strimzi and cannot be configured.
