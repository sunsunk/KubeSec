= Introduction

This guide provides information to assist contributors to the Strimzi documentation.

Strimzi documentation is written in Asciidoc.

.Inclusive language

Strimzi is committed to using inclusive and respectful language in its code, web pages, and documentation.
Contributions to the documentation, as with code submissions, must not contain problematic terms or phrases.

== Documentation tools

The following tools are needed to build the documentation:

https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor^]:: Documentation generation tool
https://www.gnu.org/software/make/[`make`^]:: Make build system to build complete documentation
https://github.com/mikefarah/yq[`yq`^]:: YAML build tool to build documentation using _make_ targets

Additionally, for generating API reference content you also need the following:

https://adoptopenjdk.net/[`java`^]:: Java for building code and generating the API reference
https://maven.apache.org/[`mvn`^]:: Maven for running the Java build

For most documentation updates, Asciidoctor offers the simplest way to check the build.

== Project layout

Strimzi uses public GitHub repositories to host files.
The following repositories contain source documentation files.

https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator[`strimzi-kafka-operator`^] (GitHub):: Strimzi operators code and related documentation.
https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-bridge[`strimzi-kafka-bridge`^] (GitHub):: Strimzi Kafka Bridge code and related documentation.
https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi.github.io[`strimzi.github.io`^] (GitHub):: Strimzi web site code and quick start documentation.

== Strimzi operators documentation

The main Strimzi documentation is maintained in the https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/tree/main/documentation[`/documentation` folder^] of the Strimzi Operators repository.
The _documentation_ folder is split into _category_ folders to manage the content.

The folders contain files related to Strimzi guides and the files that provide the content for one or more of these guides â€“ _assemblies_ and _modules_.
Assemblies, which usually encapsulate a feature or process, bring the related content contained in modules together.
An assembly is like a sub-section or chapter in a book.
A module contain a procedure, concepts or reference content.

=== Strimzi Overview guide

The intention of the _Strimzi Overview guide_ is for developing an understanding of Strimzi and Apache Kafka.
The guide does not contain any instructions.
It provides an overview of the concepts behind Apache Kafka, the Kafka component architecture, and how Strimzi supports Kafka in a Kubernetes cluster.
The guide also describes how Strimzi _Operators_ help manage a deployment.

The guide contains high-level outlines of the processes required to deploy, configure, secure and monitor a deployment of Strimzi.

=== Deploying and Managing Strimzi

The _Deploying and Managing Strimzi_ guide provides instructions on all the options available for deploying, managing and upgrading Strimzi.
The guide describes what is deployed, and the order of deployment required to run Apache Kafka in a Kubernetes cluster.

As well as describing the deployment steps, the guide also provides pre- and post-deployment instructions to prepare for and verify a deployment.
Additional deployment options described include the steps to introduce metrics.

Examples that show how you might configure components are provided.  
For example, you might want to modify your deployment and introduce additional features, such as Cruise Control or distributed tracing.

Upgrade instructions are provided for Strimzi and Kafka upgrades.

=== Strimzi Custom Resource API Reference

The _Strimzi Custom Resource API Reference_ guide describes the configuration properties for custom resources.

The reference guide is built from two files.

.Strimzi Custom Resource API Reference files
[source,asciidoc,options="nowrap"]
----
\include::modules/con-common-configuration-properties.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
\include::modules/appendix_crds.adoc[]
----

The `con-common-configuration-properties.adoc` file contains descriptions of common configuration properties.
The content for the `documentation/modules/appendix_crds.adoc` file is generated directly from descriptions in the Java code.

Java files in the `api/` folder are annotated so that the descriptions are picked up in the build.

.Java annotations for documentation
[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
import io.strimzi.crdgenerator.annotations.Description;
import io.strimzi.crdgenerator.annotations.DescriptionFile;
----

The tables in `appendix_crds.adoc` are built from `@Description` annotations in the Java files.

Additional information is included by adding:

. An `@DescriptionFile` annotation to the Java file
. A corresponding description file (`.adoc`) in the `documentation/api/` folder
. An `include:__DESCRIPTION-FILE-NAME__` reference to the `appendix_crds.adoc`

The `include:__DESCRIPTION-FILE-NAME__` reference is added automatically by the Maven build, so you do not need to add it manually.

For example, to add additional configuration for the `KafkaUserQuotas` custom resource:

. `api/src/main/java/io/strimzi/api/kafka/model/KafkaUserQuotas.java` contains:
** `import io.strimzi.crdgenerator.annotations.Description`
** `import io.strimzi.crdgenerator.annotations.DescriptionFile`
** `@Description("_descriptions for individual properties..._");`
** An `@DescriptionFile` annotation
. `documentation/api` includes the `io.strimzi.api.kafka.model.KafkaUserQuotas.adoc` file containing the additional configuration description.
+
The description file requires the same name as the related Java package.
. `appendix_crds.adoc` contains a reference to include the additional configuration description:
+
[source,asciidoc,options="nowrap"]
----
### `KafkaUserQuotas` schema reference

/include::../api/io.strimzi.api.kafka.model.user.KafkaUserQuotas.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
----

If you change anything in the `api` module of the Java code, you must rebuild the _Strimzi Custom Resource API Reference_ using a xref:make-tooling[make command].

== Kafka Bridge documentation

The Kafka Bridge documentation shows how to get started using the Kafka Bridge to make HTTP requests to a Kafka cluster.

The Kafka Bridge documentation is maintained in the https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-bridge[Strimzi Kafka Bridge project in GitHub].
For information on contributing to the Kafka Bridge documentation, see the https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-bridge/blob/main/README.md[`readme`]  in the Strimzi Kafka Bridge project.

== Quick start documentation

https://strimzi.io/quickstarts/[Strimzi quick starts] provide instructions for evaluating Strimzi using _Minikube_, _Kubernetes kind_, or _Docker Desktop_.
Steps describe how to deploy and run Strimzi as quickly as possible, with minimal configuration.

The quick starts are maintained in the https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi.github.io[Strimzi website project in GitHub].
For information on contributing to the quick starts, see the https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi.github.io/blob/main/README.md[`readme`] in the Strimzi website project.
