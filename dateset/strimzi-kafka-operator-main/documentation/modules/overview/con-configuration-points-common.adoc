= Common configuration

Some of the configuration options common to resources are described here.
xref:security-overview_{context}[Security] and xref:metrics-overview_{context}[metrics collection] might also be adopted where applicable.

Bootstrap servers:: Bootstrap servers are used for host/port connection to a Kafka cluster for:
+
* Kafka Connect
* Kafka Bridge
* Kafka MirrorMaker producers and consumers
CPU and memory resources:: You request CPU and memory resources for components. Limits specify the maximum resources that can be consumed by a given container.
+
Resource requests and limits for the Topic Operator and User Operator are set in the `Kafka` resource.
Logging:: You define the logging level for the component. Logging can be defined directly (inline) or externally using a config map.
Healthchecks:: Healthcheck configuration introduces _liveness_ and _readiness_ probes to know when to restart a container (liveness) and when a container can accept traffic (readiness).
JVM options:: JVM options provide maximum and minimum memory allocation to optimize the performance of the component according to the platform it is running on.
Pod scheduling:: Pod schedules use _affinity/anti-affinity_ rules to determine under what circumstances a pod is scheduled onto a node.
