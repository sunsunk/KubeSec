= Kafka Bridge configuration

A Kafka Bridge configuration requires a bootstrap server specification for the Kafka cluster it connects to, as well as any encryption and authentication options required.

Kafka Bridge consumer and producer configuration is standard, as described in the {ApacheKafkaConsumerConfig} and {ApacheKafkaProducerConfig}.

HTTP-related configuration options set the port connection which the server listens on.

== CORS

The Kafka Bridge supports the use of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).
CORS is a HTTP mechanism that allows browser access to selected resources from more than one origin, for example, resources on different domains.
If you choose to use CORS, you can define a list of allowed resource origins and HTTP methods for interaction with the Kafka cluster through the Kafka Bridge.
The lists are defined in the `http` specification of the Kafka Bridge configuration.

CORS allows for _simple_ and _preflighted_ requests between origin sources on different domains.

* A simple request is a HTTP request that must have an allowed origin defined in its header.
* A preflighted request sends an initial OPTIONS HTTP request before the actual request to check that the origin and the method are allowed.
