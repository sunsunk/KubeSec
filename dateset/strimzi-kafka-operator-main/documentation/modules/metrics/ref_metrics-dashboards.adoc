= Example Grafana dashboards

[role="_abstract"]
If you deploy Prometheus to provide metrics,
you can use the example Grafana dashboards provided with Strimzi to monitor Strimzi components.

Example dashboards are provided in the `examples/metrics/grafana-dashboards` directory as JSON files.

All dashboards provide JVM metrics, as well as metrics specific to the component.
For example, the Grafana dashboard for Strimzi operators provides information on the number of reconciliations or custom resources they are processing.

The example dashboards don't show all the metrics supported by Kafka.
The dashboards are populated with a representative set of metrics for monitoring.
