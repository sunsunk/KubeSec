= Configuring Cluster Operator HTTP proxy settings

[role="_abstract"]
If you are running a Kafka cluster behind a HTTP proxy, you can still pass data in and out of the cluster.
For example, you can run Kafka Connect with connectors that push and pull data from outside the proxy.
Or you can use a proxy to connect with an authorization server.

Configure the Cluster Operator deployment to specify the proxy environment variables.
The Cluster Operator accepts standard proxy configuration (`HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY`) as environment variables.
The proxy settings are applied to all Strimzi containers.

The format for a proxy address is \http://<ip_address>:<port_number>.
To set up a proxy with a name and password, the format is \http://<username>:<password>@<ip-address>:<port_number>.

.Prerequisites

* You need an account with permission to create and manage `CustomResourceDefinition` and RBAC (`ClusterRole`, and `RoleBinding`) resources.

.Procedure

. To add proxy environment variables to the Cluster Operator, update its `Deployment` configuration (`install/cluster-operator/060-Deployment-strimzi-cluster-operator.yaml`).

Alternatively, edit the `Deployment` directly:

kubectl edit deployment strimzi-cluster-operator

. If you updated the YAML file instead of editing the `Deployment` directly, apply the changes:

kubectl create -f install/cluster-operator/060-Deployment-strimzi-cluster-operator.yaml
