= Considerations when disabling topic deletion

[role="_abstract"]
When the `delete.topic.enable` configuration in Kafka is set to `false`, topics cannot be deleted. 
This might be required in certain scenarios, but it introduces a consideration when using the Topic Operator.

As topics cannot be deleted, finalizers added to the metadata of a `KafkaTopic` resource to control topic deletion are never removed by the Topic Operator (though they can be xref:con-removing-topic-finalizers-{context}[removed manually]). 
Similarly, any Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) or namespaces associated with topics cannot be deleted.

Before configuring `delete.topic.enable=false`, assess these implications to ensure it aligns with your specific requirements.

NOTE: To avoid using finalizers, you can set the `STRIMZI_USE_FINALIZERS` Topic Operator environment variable to `false`.
