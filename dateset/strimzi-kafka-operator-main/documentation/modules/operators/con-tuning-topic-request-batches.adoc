= Tuning request batches for topic operations

The Topic Operator uses the request batching capabilities of the Kafka Admin API for operations on topic resources. 
You can fine-tune the batching mechanism using the following operator configuration properties:

* `STRIMZI_MAX_QUEUE_SIZE` to set the maximum size of the topic event queue. 
The default value is 1024.
* `STRIMZI_MAX_BATCH_SIZE` to set the maximum number of topic events allowed in a single batch. 
The default value is 100.
* `MAX_BATCH_LINGER_MS` to specify the maximum time to wait for a batch to accumulate items before processing. 
The default is 100 milliseconds. 

If the maximum size of the request batching queue is exceeded, the Topic Operator shuts down and is restarted. 
To prevent frequent restarts, consider adjusting the `STRIMZI_MAX_QUEUE_SIZE` property to accommodate the typical load.
