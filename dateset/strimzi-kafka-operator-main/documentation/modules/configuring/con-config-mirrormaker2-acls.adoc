= Synchronizing ACL rules for remote topics

[role="_abstract"]
When using MirrorMaker 2 with Strimzi, it is possible to synchronize ACL rules for remote topics. 
However, this feature is only available if you are not using the User Operator.

If you are using `type: simple` authorization without the User Operator, the ACL rules that manage access to brokers also apply to remote topics. 
This means that users who have read access to a source topic can also read its remote equivalent.

NOTE: OAuth 2.0 authorization does not support access to remote topics in this way.
