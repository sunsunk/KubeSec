. If you haven't done so, xref:proc-generating-reassignment-json-files-{context}[run an interactive pod container to generate a reassignment JSON file] named `reassignment.json`.

. Copy the `reassignment.json` file to the interactive pod container.
+
[source,shell,subs=+quotes]
----
kubectl cp reassignment.json _<interactive_pod_name>_:/tmp/reassignment.json
----
+
Replace _<interactive_pod_name>_ with the name of the pod.

. Start a shell process in the interactive pod container.
+
[source,shell,subs=+quotes]
kubectl exec -n _<namespace>_ -ti _<interactive_pod_name>_ /bin/bash
+
Replace _<namespace>_ with the Kubernetes namespace where the pod is running.

. Run the partition reassignment using the `kafka-reassign-partitions.sh` script from the interactive pod container.
+
[source,shell,subs=+quotes]
----
bin/kafka-reassign-partitions.sh --bootstrap-server
 _<cluster_name>_-kafka-bootstrap:9093 \
 --command-config /tmp/config.properties \
 --reassignment-json-file /tmp/reassignment.json \
 --execute
----
+
Replace _<cluster_name>_ with the name of your Kafka cluster.
For example, `my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9093`
+
If you are going to throttle replication, you can also pass the `--throttle` option with an inter-broker throttled rate in bytes per second. For example:
+
[source,shell,subs=+quotes]
----
bin/kafka-reassign-partitions.sh --bootstrap-server
  _<cluster_name>_-kafka-bootstrap:9093 \
  --command-config /tmp/config.properties \
  --reassignment-json-file /tmp/reassignment.json \
  --throttle 5000000 \
  --execute
----
+
This command will print out two reassignment JSON objects.
The first records the current assignment for the partitions being moved.
You should save this to a local file (not a file in the pod) in case you need to revert the reassignment later on.
The second JSON object is the target reassignment you have passed in your reassignment JSON file.
+
If you need to change the throttle during reassignment, you can use the same command with a different throttled rate. For example:
+
[source,shell,subs=+quotes]
----
bin/kafka-reassign-partitions.sh --bootstrap-server
  _<cluster_name>_-kafka-bootstrap:9093 \
  --command-config /tmp/config.properties \
  --reassignment-json-file /tmp/reassignment.json \
  --throttle 10000000 \
  --execute
----

. Verify that the reassignment has completed using the `kafka-reassign-partitions.sh` command line tool from any of the broker pods.
This is the same command as the previous step, but with the `--verify` option instead of the `--execute` option.
+
[source,shell,subs=+quotes]
----
bin/kafka-reassign-partitions.sh --bootstrap-server
  _<cluster_name>_-kafka-bootstrap:9093 \
  --command-config /tmp/config.properties \
  --reassignment-json-file /tmp/reassignment.json \
  --verify
----
+
The reassignment has finished when the `--verify` command reports that each of the partitions being moved has completed successfully.
This final `--verify` will also have the effect of removing any reassignment throttles.

. You can now delete the revert file if you saved the JSON for reverting the assignment to their original brokers.
