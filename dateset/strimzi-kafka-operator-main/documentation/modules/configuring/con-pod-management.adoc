= Managing pod resources

[role="_abstract"]
The `StrimziPodSet` custom resource is used by Strimzi to create and manage Kafka, Kafka Connect, and MirrorMaker 2 pods.
If you are using ZooKeeper, ZooKeeper pods are also created and managed using `StrimziPodSet` resources.

You must not create, update, or delete `StrimziPodSet` resources.
The `StrimziPodSet` custom resource is used internally and resources are managed solely by the Cluster Operator.
As a consequence, the Cluster Operator must be running properly to avoid the possibility of pods not starting and Kafka clusters not being available.

NOTE: Kubernetes `Deployment` resources are used for creating and managing the pods of other components: Kafka Bridge, Kafka Exporter, Cruise Control, (deprecated) MirrorMaker 1, User Operator and Topic Operator.
