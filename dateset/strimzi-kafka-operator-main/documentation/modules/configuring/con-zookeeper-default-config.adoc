= Default ZooKeeper configuration values

[role="_abstract"]
When deploying ZooKeeper with Strimzi, some of the default configuration set by Strimzi differs from the standard ZooKeeper defaults. 
This is because Strimzi sets a number of ZooKeeper properties with values that are optimized for running ZooKeeper within a Kubernetes environment. 

The default configuration for key ZooKeeper properties in Strimzi is as follows:

.Default ZooKeeper Properties in Strimzi 
[cols="2m,1a,3",options="header"]
|===

|Property
|Default value
|Description

|tickTime
|2000
|The length of a single tick in milliseconds, which determines the length of a session timeout.

|initLimit
|5
|The maximum number of ticks that a follower is allowed to fall behind the leader in a ZooKeeper cluster.

|syncLimit
|2
|The maximum number of ticks that a follower is allowed to be out of sync with the leader in a ZooKeeper cluster.

|autopurge.purgeInterval
|1
|Enables the `autopurge` feature and sets the time interval in hours for purging the server-side ZooKeeper transaction log.

|admin.enableServer
|false
|Flag to disable the ZooKeeper admin server. The admin server is not used by Strimzi.

IMPORTANT: Modifying these default values as `zookeeper.config` in the `Kafka` custom resource may impact the behavior and performance of your ZooKeeper cluster.
