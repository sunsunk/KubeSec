= Deleting ZooKeeper nodes using annotations

This procedure describes how to delete an existing ZooKeeper node by using a Kubernetes annotation.
Deleting a ZooKeeper node consists of deleting both the `Pod` on which ZooKeeper is running and the related `PersistentVolumeClaim` (if the cluster was deployed with persistent storage).
After deletion, the `Pod` and its related `PersistentVolumeClaim` are recreated automatically.

WARNING: Deleting a `PersistentVolumeClaim` can cause permanent data loss and the availability of your cluster cannot be guaranteed.
The following procedure should only be performed if you have encountered storage issues.

.Prerequisites

* A running Cluster Operator

.Procedure

. Find the name of the `Pod` that you want to delete.
+
ZooKeeper pods are named `<cluster_name>-zookeeper-<index_number>`, where `<index_number>` starts at zero and ends at the total number of replicas minus one.
For example, `my-cluster-zookeeper-0`.

. Use `kubectl annotate` to annotate the `Pod` resource in Kubernetes:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,attributes+"]
kubectl annotate pod <cluster_name>-zookeeper-<index_number> strimzi.io/delete-pod-and-pvc="true"

. Wait for the next reconciliation, when the annotated pod with the underlying persistent volume claim will be deleted and then recreated.
