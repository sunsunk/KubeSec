= Configuring the Topic Operator

[role="_abstract"]
Use `topicOperator` properties in `Kafka.spec.entityOperator` to configure the Topic Operator.

The following properties are supported:

`watchedNamespace`::
The Kubernetes namespace in which the Topic Operator watches for `KafkaTopic` resources.
Default is the namespace where the Kafka cluster is deployed.

`reconciliationIntervalSeconds`::
The interval between periodic reconciliations in seconds.
Default `120`.

`image`::
The `image` property can be used to configure the container image which is used.
To learn more, refer to the information provided on link:{BookURLConfiguring}#con-common-configuration-images-reference[configuring the `image` property`^].

`resources`::
The `resources` property configures the amount of resources allocated to the Topic Operator.
You can specify requests and limits for `memory` and `cpu` resources. 
The requests should be enough to ensure a stable performance of the operator.

`logging`::
The `logging` property configures the logging of the Topic Operator.
To learn more, refer to the information provided on link:{BookURLConfiguring}#property-topic-operator-logging-reference[Topic Operator logging^].
