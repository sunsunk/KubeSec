= Connecting to ZooKeeper from a terminal

ZooKeeper services are secured with encryption and authentication and are not intended to be used by external applications that are not part of Strimzi.

However, if you want to use CLI tools that require a connection to ZooKeeper, you can use a terminal inside a ZooKeeper pod and connect to `localhost:12181` as the ZooKeeper address.

.Prerequisites

* A Kubernetes cluster is available.
* A Kafka cluster is running.
* The Cluster Operator is running.

.Procedure

. Open the terminal using the Kubernetes console or run the `exec` command from your CLI.
+
For example:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
kubectl exec -ti _my-cluster_-zookeeper-0 -- bin/zookeeper-shell.sh localhost:12181 ls /
----
+
Be sure to use `localhost:12181`.
