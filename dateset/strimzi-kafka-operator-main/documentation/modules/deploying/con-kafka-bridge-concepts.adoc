= Using the Kafka Bridge to connect with a Kafka cluster

[role="_abstract"]
You can use the Strimzi Kafka Bridge API to create and manage consumers and send and receive records over HTTP rather than the native Kafka protocol.

When you set up the Kafka Bridge you configure HTTP access to the Kafka cluster.
You can then use the Kafka Bridge to produce and consume messages from the cluster, as well as performing other operations through its REST interface.
