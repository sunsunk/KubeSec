= Deploying Kafka Connect to your Kubernetes cluster

[role="_abstract"]
This procedure shows how to deploy a Kafka Connect cluster to your Kubernetes cluster using the Cluster Operator.

A Kafka Connect cluster deployment is implemented with a configurable number of nodes (also called _workers_) that distribute the workload of connectors as _tasks_ so that the message flow is highly scalable and reliable.

The deployment uses a YAML file to provide the specification to create a `KafkaConnect` resource.

Strimzi provides xref:config-examples-{context}[example configuration files].
In this procedure, we use the following example file:

* `examples/connect/kafka-connect.yaml`

IMPORTANT: If deploying Kafka Connect clusters to run in parallel, each instance must use unique names for internal Kafka Connect topics. 
To do this, xref:con-config-kafka-connect-multiple-instances-{context}[configure each Kafka Connect instance to replace the defaults].  

.Prerequisites

* xref:deploying-cluster-operator-str[The Cluster Operator must be deployed.]
* xref:deploying-kafka-cluster-str[Running Kafka cluster.]

.Procedure

. Deploy Kafka Connect to your Kubernetes cluster.
Use the `examples/connect/kafka-connect.yaml` file to deploy Kafka Connect.

[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl apply -f examples/connect/kafka-connect.yaml
----

. Check the status of the deployment:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes"]
----
kubectl get pods -n _<my_cluster_operator_namespace>_
----
+
.Output shows the deployment name and readiness
[source,shell,subs="+quotes"]
----
NAME                                 READY  STATUS   RESTARTS
my-connect-cluster-connect-<pod_id>  1/1    Running  0
----
+
`my-connect-cluster` is the name of the Kafka Connect cluster.
+
A pod ID identifies each pod created.
+
With the default deployment, you create a single Kafka Connect pod.
+
`READY` shows the number of replicas that are ready/expected.
The deployment is successful when the `STATUS` displays as `Running`.
