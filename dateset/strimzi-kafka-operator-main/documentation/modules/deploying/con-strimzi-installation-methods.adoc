|Installation method
|Description

|xref:deploy-tasks_str[Installation artifacts (YAML files)]
a|Download the release artifacts from the {ReleaseDownload}.

Download the `strimzi-_<version>_.zip` or `strimzi-_<version>_.tar.gz` archive file.
The archive file contains installation artifacts and example configuration files.

Deploy the YAML installation artifacts to your Kubernetes cluster using `kubectl`.
You start by deploying the Cluster Operator from `install/cluster-operator` to a single namespace, multiple namespaces, or all namespaces.

You can also use the `install/` artifacts to deploy the following:

* Strimi administrator roles (`strimzi-admin`)
* A standalone Topic Operator (`topic-operator`)
* A standalone User Operator (`user-operator`)
* Strimzi Drain Cleaner (`drain-cleaner`)


|xref:deploying-strimzi-from-operator-hub-str[OperatorHub.io]
|Use the *Strimzi Kafka* operator in the OperatorHub.io to deploy the Cluster Operator. You then deploy Strimzi components using custom resources.

|xref:deploying-cluster-operator-helm-chart-str[Helm chart]
|Use a Helm chart to deploy the Cluster Operator. You then deploy Strimzi components using custom resources.

|===

For the greatest flexibility, choose the installation artifacts method.
The OperatorHub.io method provides a standard configuration and allows you to take advantage of automatic updates.
Helm charts provide a convenient way to manage the installation of applications.
