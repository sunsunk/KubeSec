= Deploying the standalone Topic Operator

[role="_abstract"]
This procedure shows how to deploy the Topic Operator as a standalone component for topic management.
You can use a standalone Topic Operator with a Kafka cluster that is not managed by the Cluster Operator.

Standalone deployment files are provided with Strimzi.
Use the `05-Deployment-strimzi-topic-operator.yaml` deployment file to deploy the Topic Operator.
Add or set the environment variables needed to make a connection to a Kafka cluster.

The Topic Operator watches for `KafkaTopic` resources in a single namespace.
You specify the namespace to watch, and the connection to the Kafka cluster, in the Topic Operator configuration.
A single Topic Operator can watch a single namespace. 
One namespace should be watched by only one Topic Operator.
If you want to use more than one Topic Operator, configure each of them to watch different namespaces.
In this way, you can use Topic Operators with multiple Kafka clusters.  

.Prerequisites

* You are running a Kafka cluster for the Topic Operator to connect to.
+
As long as the standalone Topic Operator is correctly configured for connection,
the Kafka cluster can be running on a bare-metal environment, a virtual machine, or as a managed cloud application service.

.Procedure

. Edit the `env` properties in the `install/topic-operator/05-Deployment-strimzi-topic-operator.yaml` standalone deployment file.

----
<1> The Kubernetes namespace for the Topic Operator to watch for `KafkaTopic` resources. Specify the namespace of the Kafka cluster.
<2> The host and port pair of the bootstrap broker address to discover and connect to all brokers in the Kafka cluster.
Use a comma-separated list to specify two or three broker addresses in case a server is down.
<3> The label to identify the `KafkaTopic` resources managed by the Topic Operator.
This does not have to be the name of the Kafka cluster.
It can be the label assigned to the `KafkaTopic` resource.
If you deploy more than one Topic Operator, the labels must be unique for each.
That is, the operators cannot manage the same resources.
<4> The interval between periodic reconciliations, in milliseconds.
The default is `120000` (2 minutes).
<5> The level for printing logging messages.
You can set the level to `ERROR`, `WARNING`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`, or `TRACE`.
<6> Enables TLS support for encrypted communication with the Kafka brokers.
<7> (Optional) The Java options used by the JVM running the Topic Operator.
<8> (Optional) The debugging (`-D`) options set for the Topic Operator.
<9> (Optional) Skips the generation of trust store certificates if TLS is enabled through `STRIMZI_TLS_ENABLED`. If this environment variable is enabled, the brokers must use a public trusted certificate authority for their TLS certificates.
The default is `false`.
<10> (Optional) Generates key store certificates for mTLS authentication. Setting this to `false` disables client authentication with mTLS to the Kafka brokers.
The default is `true`.
<11> (Optional) Enables SASL support for client authentication when connecting to Kafka brokers.
The default is `false`.
<12> (Optional) The SASL username for client authentication.
Mandatory only if SASL is enabled through `STRIMZI_SASL_ENABLED`.
<13> (Optional) The SASL password for client authentication.
Mandatory only if SASL is enabled through `STRIMZI_SASL_ENABLED`.
<14> (Optional) The SASL mechanism for client authentication.
Mandatory only if SASL is enabled through `STRIMZI_SASL_ENABLED`.
You can set the value to `plain`, `scram-sha-256`, or `scram-sha-512`.
<15> (Optional) The security protocol used for communication with Kafka brokers.
The default value is "PLAINTEXT".
You can set the value to `PLAINTEXT`, `SSL`, `SASL_PLAINTEXT`, or `SASL_SSL`.
<16> Set `STRIMZI_USE_FINALIZERS` to `false` if you do not want to use finalizers to control xref:con-deleting-managed-topics-{context}[topic deletion].

. If you want to connect to Kafka brokers that are using certificates from a public certificate authority, set `STRIMZI_PUBLIC_CA` to `true`. Set this property to `true`, for example, if you are using Amazon AWS MSK service.
. If you enabled mTLS with the `STRIMZI_TLS_ENABLED` environment variable, specify the keystore and truststore used to authenticate connection to the Kafka cluster.

----
<1> The truststore contains the public keys of the Certificate Authorities used to sign the Kafka and ZooKeeper server certificates.
<2> The password for accessing the truststore.
<3> The keystore contains the private key for mTLS authentication.
<4> The password for accessing the keystore.

. Apply the changes to the `Deployment` configuration to deploy the Topic Operator.

. Check the status of the deployment:

[source,shell,subs="+quotes"]
----
kubectl get deployments
----

.Output shows the deployment name and readiness
[source,shell,subs="+quotes"]
----
NAME                    READY  UP-TO-DATE  AVAILABLE
strimzi-topic-operator  1/1    1           1
----

`READY` shows the number of replicas that are ready/expected.
The deployment is successful when the `AVAILABLE` output shows `1`.
