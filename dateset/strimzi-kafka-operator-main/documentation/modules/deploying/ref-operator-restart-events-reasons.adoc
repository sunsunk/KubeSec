a|Event
|Description

|CaCertHasOldGeneration
|The pod is still using a server certificate signed with an old CA, so needs to be restarted as part of the certificate update.

|CaCertRemoved
|Expired CA certificates have been removed, and the pod is restarted to run with the current certificates.

|CaCertRenewed
|CA certificates have been renewed, and the pod is restarted to run with the updated certificates.

|ClientCaCertKeyReplaced
|The key used to sign clients CA certificates has been replaced, and the pod is being restarted as part of the CA renewal process.

|ClusterCaCertKeyReplaced
|The key used to sign the cluster's CA certificates has been replaced, and the pod is being restarted as part of the CA renewal process.

|ConfigChangeRequiresRestart
|Some Kafka configuration properties are changed dynamically, but others require that the broker be restarted.

|FileSystemResizeNeeded
|The file system size has been increased, and a restart is needed to apply it.

|KafkaCertificatesChanged
|One or more TLS certificates used by the Kafka broker have been updated, and a restart is needed to use them.

|ManualRollingUpdate
|A user annotated the pod, or the `StrimziPodSet` set it belongs to, to trigger a restart.

|PodForceRestartOnError
|An error occurred that requires a pod restart to rectify.

|PodHasOldRevision
|A disk was added or removed from the Kafka volumes, and a restart is needed to apply the change. When using `StrimziPodSet` resources, the same reason is given if the pod needs to be recreated.

|PodHasOldRevision
|The `StrimziPodSet` that the pod is a member of has been updated, so the pod needs to be recreated. When using `StrimziPodSet` resources, the same reason is given if a disk was added or removed from the Kafka volumes.

|PodStuck
|The pod is still pending, and is not scheduled or cannot be scheduled, so the operator has restarted the pod in a final attempt to get it running.

|PodUnresponsive
|Strimzi was unable to connect to the pod, which can indicate a broker not starting correctly, so the operator restarted it in an attempt to resolve the issue.
