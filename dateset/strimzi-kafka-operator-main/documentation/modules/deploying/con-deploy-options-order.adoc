= Order of deployment

[role="_abstract"]
The required order of deployment to a Kubernetes cluster is as follows:

. Deploy the Cluster Operator to manage your Kafka cluster
. Deploy the Kafka cluster with the ZooKeeper cluster, and include the Topic Operator and User Operator in the deployment
. Optionally deploy:
** The Topic Operator and User Operator standalone if you did not deploy them with the Kafka cluster
** Kafka Connect
** Kafka MirrorMaker
** Kafka Bridge
** Components for the monitoring of metrics

The Cluster Operator creates Kubernetes resources for the components,
such as `Deployment`, `Service`, and `Pod` resources.
The names of the Kubernetes resources are appended with the name specified for a component when it's deployed.
For example, a Kafka cluster named `my-kafka-cluster` has a service named `my-kafka-cluster-kafka`.
