= Pushing container images to your own registry

Container images for Strimzi are available in the {DockerRepository}.
The installation YAML files provided by Strimzi will pull the images directly from the {DockerRepository}.

If you do not have access to the {DockerRepository} or want to use your own container repository:

. Pull *all* container images listed here
. Push them into your own registry
. Update the image names in the YAML files used in deployment

NOTE: Each Kafka version supported for the release has a separate image.
