= Upgrading the Cluster Operator using installation files

[role="_abstract"]
This procedure describes how to upgrade a Cluster Operator deployment to use Strimzi {ProductVersion}.

Follow this procedure if you deployed the Cluster Operator using the installation YAML files.

The availability of Kafka clusters managed by the Cluster Operator is not affected by the upgrade operation.

NOTE: Refer to the documentation supporting a specific version of Strimzi for information on how to upgrade to that version.

.Prerequisites

* An existing Cluster Operator deployment is available.
* You have xref:downloads-{context}[downloaded the release artifacts for Strimzi {ProductVersion}].

.Procedure

. Take note of any configuration changes made to the existing Cluster Operator resources (in the `/install/cluster-operator` directory).
Any changes will be *overwritten* by the new version of the Cluster Operator.

. Update your custom resources to reflect the supported configuration options available for Strimzi version {ProductVersion}.

. Update the Cluster Operator.

.. Modify the installation files for the new Cluster Operator version according to the namespace the Cluster Operator is running in.
+
include::../../shared/snip-cluster-operator-namespace-sed.adoc[]
+
.. If you modified one or more environment variables in your existing Cluster Operator `Deployment`, edit the
`install/cluster-operator/060-Deployment-strimzi-cluster-operator.yaml` file to use those environment variables.

. When you have an updated configuration, deploy it along with the rest of the installation resources:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
kubectl replace -f install/cluster-operator
----
+
Wait for the rolling updates to complete.

. If the new Operator version no longer supports the Kafka version you are upgrading from, the Cluster Operator returns an error message to say the version is not supported.
Otherwise, no error message is returned.

* If the error message is returned, upgrade to a Kafka version that is supported by the new Cluster Operator version:

.. Edit the `Kafka` custom resource.

.. Change the `spec.kafka.version` property to a supported Kafka version.

* If the error message is _not_ returned, go to the next step.
You will upgrade the Kafka version later.

. Get the image for the Kafka pod to ensure the upgrade was successful:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
kubectl get pods my-cluster-kafka-0 -o jsonpath='{.spec.containers[0].image}'
----
+
The image tag shows the new Strimzi version followed by the Kafka version:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
{ExampleImageTagUpgrades}
----
+
You can also xref:con-upgrade-status-{context}[check the upgrade has completed successfully from the status of the `Kafka` resource].

The Cluster Operator is upgraded to version {ProductVersion}, but the version of Kafka running in the cluster it manages is unchanged.
