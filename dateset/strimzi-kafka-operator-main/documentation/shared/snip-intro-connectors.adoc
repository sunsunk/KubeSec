//standard connector intro text
Kafka Connect uses a plugin architecture to provide the implementation artifacts for connectors.
Plugins allow connections to other systems and provide additional configuration to manipulate data.
Plugins include connectors and other components, such as data converters and transforms.
A connector operates with a specific type of external system.
Each connector defines a schema for its configuration.
You supply the configuration to Kafka Connect to create a connector instance within Kafka Connect.
Connector instances then define a set of tasks for moving data between systems.
