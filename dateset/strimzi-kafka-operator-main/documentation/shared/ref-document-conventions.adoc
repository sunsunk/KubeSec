.User-replaced values

User-replaced values, also known as _replaceables_, are shown in with angle brackets (< >).
Underscores ( _ ) are used for multi-word values.
If the value refers to code or commands, `monospace` is also used.

For example, the following code shows that `_<my_namespace>_` must be replaced by the correct namespace name:

[source, subs="+quotes"]
----
sed -i 's/namespace: .\*/namespace: <my_namespace>/' install/cluster-operator/*RoleBinding*.yaml
----
