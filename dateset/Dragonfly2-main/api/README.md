# Dragonfly V2 API

We encourage users to experience Dragonfly in different ways.
When doing this, there are three ways users
could choose to interact with dragonfly mostly:

* For end-users, command line tool `dfget`, `dfdaemon` is mostly used.
* For developers, Dragonfly manager's raw API is
  the original thing they would make use of.
  For more details about API docs, please refer to [api.md](./manager/swagger.json).
  We should also keep it in mind that doc
  [apis.md](./manager/swagger.json) is automatically generated by
  [swagger2markup](https://github.com/Swagger2Markup/swagger2markup).
  Please **DO NOT** edit [api.md](./manager/swagger.json) directly.

Directory `/api` mainly describes the second part **Dragonfly Manager's Raw API**.

Currently, the description of swagger format is provided,
which can be viewed in `manager`.
It contains two format files of swagger, JSON and yaml. You can
browse through relevant viewing tools to obtain the specific call method of API,
or view online through the `/swagger/doc.json` endpoint of manager service.

Through manager's API, you can integrate with your own services,
so you can automatically manage dragonfly and improve the level of Devops.
