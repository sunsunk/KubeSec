### Opening a pull request (PR)

Steps:

1. Check if there is an [open issue](https://github.com/kube-logging/logging-operator/issues) that you can reference in your pull request
2. Fork the [repository](https://github.com/kube-logging/logging-operator/fork)
3. Create a new branch using `git switch -c <branch-name>`
4. Make your modifications and add unit tests to cover most code branches, input fields, and functionality if possible[^1]
5. Run `make fmt` to run code formatting
6. Run `make generate` to generate code, documentation, manifests, etc.
7. Run `make check` to run license checks, linter, tests
8. (Optional) run `make lint-fix` to fix trivial linting problems
9. Commit your modifications (preferably many smaller commits) using `git commit -s`, because [DCO check](https://github.com/apps/dco) is required
10. Push your commits (`git push <fork_origin> <fork_name>`) and open a pull request

See the [For developers](https://kube-logging.dev/docs/developers/) page in the documentation for details (e.g. setting up a development environment, adding documentation).

[^1]: For bigger features please open a new [Feature request issue](https://github.com/kube-logging/logging-operator/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=--feature-request.md&title=) where we can have a discussion about the proposed feature and the suggested test cases.
