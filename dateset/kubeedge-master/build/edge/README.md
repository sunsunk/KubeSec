## Deploy kubeedge's edge nodes using containers

**Note:** The files in this directory have been deprecated. The containerized deployment of edgecore should only be used for
testing and is not recommended for production use.

- EdgeCore's containerized deployment solution for performance testing can be found in [EdgeMark](../edgemark)
- EdgeCore in docker, easily spin up a multi nodes KubeEdge cluster in just one machine, see [Keink sub-project](https://github.com/kubeedge/keink)
