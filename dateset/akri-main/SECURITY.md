## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Akri team and community take security vulnerabilities very seriously. If you find a security-related issue with Akri, we kindly ask you send a report privately to cncf-akri-security@lists.cncf.io and to give us an appropriate time to address and mitigate the vulnerability. All reports will be thoroughly investigated by the Akri maintainers.

## Disclosure

We will disclose any security vulnerabilities in our [Security Advisories](https://github.com/project-akri/akri/security/advisories).

All vulnerabilities and associated information will be treated with full confidentiality. We are thankful for your efforts in keeping Akri secure and we will publicly acknowledge your contributions if you wish.
