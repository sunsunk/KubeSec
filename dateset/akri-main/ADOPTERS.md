# Adopters

If you are using Akri in your solutions, we would love to have your organization in our adopters list. This is a small contribution that helps the project gain momentum and support.

To add your organization to this list, feel free to PR the additions to this page, following [our contributor guide](https://docs.akri.sh/community/contributing). Alternatively, reach out to us on [Slack](http://aka.ms/akri/channel) if you have any questions or need help around this process.
