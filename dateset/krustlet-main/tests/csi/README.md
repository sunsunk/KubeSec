# CSI Test directory

This directory contains the config for CSI RBAC (necessary if you are using
KinD). Required binaries for the test are downloaded automatically when you use
the `justfile`. Right now we only run these things on Linux because the
Registrar is still missing [MacOS
support](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/node-driver-registrar/pull/133) and
the mock driver would need to handle Windows, which would reuse our ugly code.
It may be worth making some sort of more fully featured and separate mock driver
in the future

## Why not use the Docker images for these?

Those would work here for our e2e tests since we are running a KinD node.
However, we want these tests to reflect more real world usage and there is no
guarantee that a Krustlet node will have a container runtime (nor do we want to
require one). There is also the additional benefit of having this be some simple
instructions of how you can build some of the key components to get CSI running
for a Real Worldâ„¢ cluster.
