# Note:
#
# The command Id are merged *per-event type*
# from the commands of the corresponding event type
# in parent, plugins and devfile main content. 
#
# The command Ids in each event type are unordered sets.
# Only event types are ordered; no guarantee is provided that
# Commands inside an event type will be executed in the order
# they appear in the list.
#
# However in the test results, as it will happen usually,
# command ids of a given event type will simply be ordered
# in alphabetical order.
