# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security issues seriously and discourage anyone to spread security issues. If you find a security issue in Inclavare Containers, please do not discuss it in public and even do not open a public issue. Instead we encourage you to send us a private email to
[security@inclavare-containers.io](mailto:security@inclavare-containers.io) to report the security issue.
