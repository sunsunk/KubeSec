# Lima roadmap

Instead of using a static text file, Lima uses the `roadmap` label on GitHub issues to designate features or bug fixes that we plan to implement.

Issues are tagged with the `roadmap` label when at least one maintainer or contributor has declared intent to work on or help with the implementation.

There are no commitments or timelines attached to the label, and the label may be removed again from an abandoned issue at any time.

Non-roadmap issues are kept open (as long as they fit the scope of the project) in case a volunteer one day appears and offers to work on them.

To find the items currently planned for Lima you can filter on [open issues with the `roadmap` label]( https://github.com/lima-vm/lima/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aroadmap).
