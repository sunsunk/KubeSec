### IllegalInheritError (E2D34)

KCL will report `IllegalInheritError` when an illegal inheritance occurs in the schema.

The `ewcode` of `IllegalInheritError` is `E2D34`.

For example:

```python
schema FullnameMixin:
    fullName = "{} {}".format(firstName, lastName)

schema Scholar(FullnameMixin): # mixin inheritance is illegal
    school: str
```

The KCL program will cause the following error message.

```shell
error[E2D34]: IllegalInheritError
 --> /schema/inherit/inherit_mixin_fail/main.k:4:16
  |
4 | schema Scholar(FullnameMixin):
  |                ^ invalid schema inherit object type, expect schema, got 'FullnameMixin'
  |
```

Possible resolution:

- Schema supports single inheritance of schema in KCL.
