### IndentationError (E1003)

KCL will report `KCLIndentationError` when KCL has an indentation syntax error.

The KCL syntax includes indentation. A tab or four white spaces in KCL represents an indentation. The other cases will be regarded as syntax errors by KCL.

For example:

```python
schema Person:
    name: str # a tab or four white spaces is legal.
   age: int # three white spaces are illegal
  info: str # two white spaces is illegal
```

The KCL program will cause the following error message.

```shell
error[E1001]: InvalidSyntax
 --> /syntax_error/indent/indent_error_0/main.k:3:4
  |
3 |    age: int # three white spaces are illegal
  |    ^ unindent 3 does not match any outer indentation level
  |
```

Possible resolution:

- Only use a tab or four white spaces in the KCL program for indentation.
