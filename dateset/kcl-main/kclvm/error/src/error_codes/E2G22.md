### TypeError (E2G22)

KCL will report `TypeError` when a type error occurs in compiling type check.

The `ewcode` of `TypeError` is `E2G22`.

For example:

```python
schema Person:
    firstName: str
    lastName: int

JohnDoe = Person {
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe" # Type Error，lastName: int，“Doe” is a string.
}
```

The KCL program will cause the following error message.

```shell
error[E2G22]: TypeError
 --> type/type_fail_0/main.k:7:5
  |
7 |     "lastName": "Doe" # Type Error，lastName: int，“Doe” is a string.
  |     ^ expected int, got str(Doe)
  |

 --> type/type_fail_0/main.k:3:5
  |
3 |     lastName: int
  |     ^ variable is defined here, its type is int, but got str(Doe)
  |
```
