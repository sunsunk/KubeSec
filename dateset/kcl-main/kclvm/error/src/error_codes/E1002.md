### KCLTabError (E1002)

KCL will report `KCLTabError` when KCL has a tab and white space syntax error.

In KCL, it is forbidden to mix tabs and four spaces in one indentation block. And we recommend only using white spaces or tabs for indentation in the entire KCL project, donâ€™t mix them.

For example:

```python
schema Person:
    name: str # begin with a tab
    age: int # begin with four white spaces, 
             # and four white spaces != tab in the env
```

The KCL program will cause the following error message.

```shell
error[E1001]: InvalidSyntax
 --> File /syntax_error/tab/tab_error_0/main.k:6:5
  |
3 |     age: int = 1
  |     ^ inconsistent use of tabs and spaces in indentation
  |
```

Possible resolution:

- Only use a tab or four white spaces in KCL, do not mix them.
