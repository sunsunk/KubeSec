## CannotFindModule (E2F04)

KCL will report `CannotFindModule` when KCL imports a module that does not exist.

The `ewcode` of `CannotFindModule` is `E2F04`.

For example:

```python
import .some0.pkg1 as some00  # some0 not found in package

Name1 = some00.Name  # some0.pkg1.name
```

The KCL program will cause the following error message.

```shell
error[E2F04]: CannotFindModule
 --> import_abs_fail_0/app-main/main.k:1:1
  |
1 | import .some0.pkg1 as some00  # some0 not found in package
  |  Cannot find the module .some0.pkg1
  |
```
