# Example Plugin: Set up clusters dynamically

Configure (or update) a cluster dynamically that can then be used throughout Headlamp.

Headlamp supports both dynamic and static cluster configurations.

### Static Clusters (Default):

- If dynamic cluster is disabled (default setting), Headlamp prompts users to manually enter information about the cluster, including the cluster name and server details.
- Users can submit the form, and Headlamp will load the cluster based on the provided information.

### Dynamic Clusters (Enable with -enable-dynamic-clusters flag):

- When dynamic cluster is enabled on the backend using the -enable-dynamic-clusters flag, Headlamp allows users to paste the base64 encoded value of their kubeconfig.
- Upon submission, Headlamp seamlessly loads the cluster statelessly using the provided kubeconfig information.
