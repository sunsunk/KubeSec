## Introduction
LitmusChaos is an open source Chaos Engineering platform that enables teams to identify weaknesses & potential outages in infrastructures by 
inducing chaos tests in a controlled way. Developers & SREs can practice Chaos Engineering with LitmusChaos as it is easy to use, based on modern 
Chaos Engineering principles & community collaborated. It is 100% open source & a CNCF project.

LitmusChaos takes a cloud-native approach to create, manage and monitor chaos. The platform itself runs as a set of microservices and uses Kubernetes 
custom resources (CRs) to define the chaos intent, as well as the steady state hypothesis.
