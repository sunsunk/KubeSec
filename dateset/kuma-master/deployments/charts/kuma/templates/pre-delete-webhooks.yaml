# HELM first deletes RBAC of Kuma, then it tries to delete Secrets. We've got validating webhook on Secrets.
# But even that the policy of this webhook is Ignore, it fails because Kuma does not have permission to access Secrets anymore.
# Therefore we first need to delete webhook so we can delete the rest of the deployment
