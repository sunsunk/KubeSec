## Proposals

If you wish to add a larger feature or make a major refactor to Kubeflow Notebooks we encourage folks to write up a proposal document.
Though our process is not formal, the convention is to create a PR against Kubeflow Notebooks with your proposal as markdown in the
proposals folder. Proposal reviews and feedback will happen on the PR with the proposal.

```
    components/proposals     <- folder
        YYYYMMDD-title.md    <- file
```

In your proposal it is good to consider and include some of the following:
* Goals
* Non-Goals
* Does this break any public API?
* Does this fix/solve any outstanding issues?
* Does this require user-facing docs?
