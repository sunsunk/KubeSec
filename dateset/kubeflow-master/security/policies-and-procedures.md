# Policies and Procedures

Currently the team is working to finalize this work and have it completed for the 1.8 Release and for the transition to the CNCF.
These policies and procedures will be based of the [Kubernetes Policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/issues-security/security/)
We are working on updating and editing these policies and procedures for the Kubeflow Community.  Our very **rough DRAFT and working docs** can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sjWa0G2UqdsP1QROYVEl9iQR6v1x8HD7-F4TQo7lV6M/edit?usp=sharing).
