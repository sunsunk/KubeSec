# Pluggable Secret Stores

* Owner: Hasan TÃ¼rken (@turkenh)
* Reviewers: Crossplane Maintainers
* Status: Draft

## Background

In the [v1.7.0] release, we have introduced support for publishing connection
details secrets to [External Secret Stores] as an alpha feature. With this
initial iteration, we have focused on the _in-tree_ implementation of secret
stores by adding [Hashicorp's Vault] support as our first External Secret Store.
However, this approach introduces [additional dependencies] to Crossplane core
and would not scale once the community wants to support more secret stores.
Even further, it won't be possible to use an in-house secret store with
Crossplane since adding support for such a store to Crossplane core wouldn't
make sense. For this purpose, with the initial design, we set it as a [goal] to
support switching to an out-of-tree (plugin) model but intentionally left it
[out of scope] to avoid the upfront complexity.

With the gained confidence, we can now iterate with a more scalable option by
supporting pluggable secret stores.

## Goals

The goal of this document is to propose a pluggable secret store mechanism
that enables the development and consumption of out-of-tree secret store
plugins.

This new mechanism should:
- Allow building/using new secret stores for Crossplane without making any
  changes in Crossplane and/or Provider repositories.
- Provide a smooth development and consumption experience.
- Have secure communication with the plugin process.

## Proposal

This document proposes introducing a plugin mechanism for communicating with
External Secret Stores. We will follow a similar approach as [KMS plugins] used
by Kubernetes API Server for encryption at rest. A Secret Store plugin will
be serving a well-defined API via gRPC. To have a secure communication, we will
deploy plugins as a separate deployment and enforce mTLS.

### API

In addition to the existing Secret Store types, `Kubernetes` and `Vault`, we
will define a new type named as `Plugin`. We will deprecate the existing type
`Vault` in favor of a plugin supporting **Vault** to remove the dependencies
already introduced. With this, `Kubernetes` and `Plugin` will be the only two
built-in types going forward.

Configuration of this type would require passing a typed reference to another
configuration custom resource defined by the deployed secret store plugin.

```yaml
apiVersion: gcp.crossplane.io/v1alpha1
kind: StoreConfig
metadata:
  name: vault
spec:
  type: Plugin
  defaultScope: crossplane-system
  external:
    endpoint: ess-plugin-vault:4040  # Service endpoint of the plugin.
    configRef:
      apiVersion: secrets.crossplane.io/v1alpha1
      kind: VaultConfig
      name: vault-internal
---
apiVersion: secrets.crossplane.io/v1alpha1
kind: VaultConfig
metadata:
  name: vault-internal
spec:
  server: http://vault.vault-system:8200
  mountPath: secrets/
  version: v2
  auth:
    method: Token
    token:
      source: Secret
      secretRef:
        namespace: crossplane-system
        name: vault-token
        key: token
```

There won't be any API changes at MR/XR/XRC level as they would still refer to
a `StoreConfig` resource as before.

### Implementation

We will implement the `Plugin` [Secret Store] type in Crossplane Runtime which
will use a gRPC client to communicate with the plugin server using the service
definition below:

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

// This service defines the APIs for an External Secret Store plugin.
service ExternalSecretStoreService {
    rpc GetSecret(GetSecretRequest) returns (GetSecretResponse) {}
    rpc ApplySecret(ApplySecretRequest) returns (ApplySecretResponse) {}
    rpc DeleteKeys(DeleteKeysRequest) returns (DeleteKeysResponse) {}
}

message ConfigReference {
    string api_version = 1;
    string kind = 2;
    string name = 3;
}
message Secret {
    string scoped_name = 1;
    map<string, string> metadata = 2;
    map<string, bytes> data = 3;
}
message GetSecretRequest {
    ConfigReference config = 1;
    Secret secret = 2;
    GetOptions options = 3;
}
message GetSecretResponse {
    Secret secret = 1;
}
message ApplySecretRequest {
    ConfigReference config = 1;
    Secret secret = 2;
    ApplyOptions options = 3;
}
message ApplySecretResponse {
    bool changed = 1;
}
message DeleteKeysRequest {
    ConfigReference config = 1;
    Secret secret = 2;
    DeleteOptions options = 3;
}
message DeleteKeysResponse {}
message GetOptions {}
message ApplyOptions {}
message DeleteOptions {
    bool keep_empty_secret = 1;
}
```

A _Secret Store Plugin_:

- Will be a binary packaged as a container image.
- Should run as a gRPC server.
- Should support one Secret Store.
- Should deploy CRD(s) for supported store configurations at startup.
- Should have server certificates for mTLS configuration.
- Should require and verify client certificates.

### Deployment

Deployment of a Secret Store Plugin will be similar to the current provider
deployment, with one exception. We need to generate a server certificate
during deployment time and mount it to the plugin pod. This is required to enable
mTLS communication.

In addition to the server certificates, we will generate a client certificate
for each provider and store it in a k8s secret. These certificates will be
generated by the package manager during the package installation.

Since the core Crossplane communicates with the secret stores as well, it will also
act as a gRPC client to communicate with the plugin. Hence, it will need a client 
certificate. To provide this certificate, we will create an empty secret with
the Crossplane helm chart and mount it to the Crossplane pod. The init container
will then fill the secret with the client certificate similar to how webhook 
certificates are provided today.

All these certificates will be signed by the cluster's root CA certificate with proper
subject and DNS names and stored as k8s secrets. Rotation of these certificates can
be triggered by deleting those secrets and restarting the Crossplane pod.

### Runtime

A typical flow during a Managed Resource publishing a connection secret to a
pluggable Secret Store will be as follows:

1. Managed reconciler of Crossplane Runtime will call [PublishConnection] method
   of `connection.DetailsManager`.
2. At [connectStore] step, a gRPC connection is created by dialing the gRPC
   server of the secret store plugin's k8s service endpoint.
3. In `WriteKeyValues` method of `Plugin` Secret Store, `ApplySecret` gRPC
   method called with `configReference` and `secret` parameters:

```go
func (ss *SecretStore) WriteKeyValues(ctx context.Context, s *store.Secret, _ ...store.WriteOption) (changed bool, err error) {
	// TODO(turkenh): handle write options.
	resp, err := pb.NewExternalSecretStoreServiceClient(ss.conn).ApplySecret(ctx, &pb.ApplySecretRequest{
		Config: &pb.ConfigReference{
			ApiVersion: ss.pluginConfigRef.APIVersion,
			Kind:       ss.pluginConfigRef.Kind,
			Name:       ss.pluginConfigRef.Name,
		},
		Secret: &pb.Secret{
			ScopedName: filepath.Join(s.Scope, s.Name),
			Metadata:   s.Metadata.Labels,
			Data:       s.Data,
		},
	})
	if err != nil {
		return false, err
	}
	return resp.Changed, nil
}
```

4. The plugin receives the `ApplySecret` request:
    1. It will fetch the referenced configuration object, e.g. `VaultConfig`,
       from the Kubernetes API.
    2. Using this configuration, it will connect to the External Secret Store,
       i.e. Vault, and write the secret data.

## Alternatives Considered

### Deploy Plugin as a Sidecar

Instead of deploying plugins as separate deployments, it was initially proposed to
deploy them as sidecars. The main motivation behind this was eliminating authentication
complications and having secure communication via sockets. However, adding sidecars
to Crossplane and providers will make the packaging and deployment processes more complicated.
For example, when we want to install a new plugin, we will need to inject it to the
core Crossplane and existing providers. Injecting the plugin to the Crossplane would 
require a helm upgrade which is not possible by the package manager or a mutating webhook.
The second complication is that if we want to install multiple plugins on a single cluster, 
we end up having multiple sidecars for the Crossplane and providers which causes 
having multiple processes for the same purpose.

### Use a Mutating Webhook to Inject Plugin Sidecars

We could use a Mutating Webhook to inject plugin sidecars instead of modifying
the Crossplane helm chart and package manager code similar to the
[Vault agent injector]. However, this would mean introducing one more component
for a work that we could already accomplish with some simple changes in the
existing components. In other words, considering plugin sidecars will not need
to be injected to some arbitrary pods other than Crossplane and Providers, there
is not much need for this approach.

### Use the CA Certificate Generated for Webhooks

We propose to use Kubernetes CA to sign the certificates instead of using the self-signed
CA created for the webhooks. The main reason for this is that we do not want to couple
two different features and make them dependent on each other.
