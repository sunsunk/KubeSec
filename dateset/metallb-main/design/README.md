# Design Documents

To enable reviews against design proposals in the same way that we review code
contributions, please create design proposals as markdown formatted files in
this directory.

While we do not have strict requirements on the outline of the proposal, we
encourage the use of the [Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal (KEP)
template](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/NNNN-kep-template)
as inspiration.
