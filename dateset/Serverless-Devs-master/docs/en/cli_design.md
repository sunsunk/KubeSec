# Command line design specification

Serverless Devs, as a developer tool in the serverless field, the standardization and standardization of its output will have a more obvious impact on the user experience to a certain extent.

This document will standardize and upgrade the output of Serverless Devs command line tools through some text and cases.

## Specification details

The canonical goals of the output format are:

- Clearer
- More concise
- Does not affect the function and practicality

Based on the above three principles, we can use examples to illustrate the normal output form and the abnormal output form.

### Basic output

The basic output form includes two parts as a whole:

1. Project implementation phase

The project execution phase mainly includes a basic format:

```
âŒ› Steps for process
====================
```

The rewrite mechanism is used to continuously update the output content. After each project is executed, the corresponding result can be output. Example:

```
âŒ› Steps for process
====================
âœ” Pre-action completed (10s)
```

2. Result output stage

The project execution phase mainly includes a basic format:

```
ðŸš€ Result for process
====================
```

The specific project output is output in the format of `Yaml`. When outputting, the project name should be underlined. If there is no output, the project will be ended directly. Example:

```
ðŸš€ Result for process
====================
âœ” MyProject deployed (11s)
fc-deploy-test:
  region: cn-hangzhou
  service:
    name: fc-deploy-service
    memorySize: 128
```

#### Multi-project output example

### Debug mode

When the user enters the debug mode with `--debug`, very detailed information will be printed on the console, but the information will be printed out in gray to maintain the overall sense of hierarchy:

### Error output

When an error occurs in execution, Serverless Devs must sense and output the corresponding content:

```
âŒ› Steps for process
====================
âœ” MyProject pre-action completed (10s)
âœ– MyProject failed to deploy:

Error Message:
t[r] is not a function
