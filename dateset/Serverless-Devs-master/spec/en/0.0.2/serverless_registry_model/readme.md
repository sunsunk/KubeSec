# Registry model

This section describes an open Serverless Registry Model. Package developers can publish their own components and share intended applications to a platform. The platform can use GitHub Registry, Gitee Registry, and Serverless Registry, which are supported by Serverless Devs. You can also build a private registry based on the specification.
