## Release Note
### **v1.5.0 released!** ðŸŽ†

Longhorn v1.5.0 is the latest version of Longhorn 1.5.
It introduces many enhancements, improvements, and bug fixes as described below including performance, stability, maintenance, resilience, and so on. Please try it and feedback. Thanks for all the contributions!

> For the definition of stable or latest release, please check [here](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn#releases).

  - [v2 Data Engine based on SPDK - Preview](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/5751)
    > **Please note that this is a preview feature, so should not be used in any production environment. A preview feature is disabled by default and would be changed in the following versions until it becomes general availability.**
    
    In addition to the existing iSCSI stack (v1) data engine, we are introducing the v2 data engine based on SPDK (Storage Performance Development Kit). This release includes the introduction of volume lifecycle management, degraded volume handling, offline replica rebuilding, block device management, and orphaned replica management. For the performance benchmark and comparison with v1, check the report [here](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.5.0/spdk/performance-benchmark/).

  - [Longhorn Volume Attachment](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/3715)
    Introducing the new Longhorn VolumeAttachment CR, which ensures exclusive attachment and supports automatic volume attachment and detachment for various headless operations such as volume cloning, backing image export, and recurring jobs.

  - [Cluster Autoscaler - GA](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/5238)
    Cluster Autoscaler was initially introduced as an experimental feature in v1.3. After undergoing automatic validation on different public cloud Kubernetes distributions and receiving user feedback, it has now reached general availability.

  - [Instance Manager Engine & Replica Consolidation](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/5208)
    Previously, there were two separate instance manager pods responsible for volume engine and replica process management. However, this setup required high resource usage, especially during live upgrades. In this release, we have merged these pods into a single instance manager, reducing the initial resource requirements.

  - [Volume Backup Compression Methods](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/5189)
    Longhorn supports different compression methods for volume backups, including lz4, gzip, or no compression. This allows users to choose the most suitable method based on their data type and usage requirements.

  - [Automatic Volume Trim Recurring Job](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/5186)
    While volume filesystem trim was introduced in v1.4, users had to perform the operation manually. From this release, users can create a recurring job that automatically runs the trim process, improving space efficiency without requiring human intervention.

  - [RWX Volume Trim](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/5143)
    Longhorn supports filesystem trim for RWX (Read-Write-Many) volumes, expanding the trim functionality beyond RWO (Read-Write-Once) volumes only.

  - [Upgrade Path Enforcement & Downgrade Prevention](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/5131)
    To ensure compatibility after an upgrade, we have implemented upgrade path enforcement. This prevents unintended downgrades and ensures the system and data remain intact.

  - [Backing Image Management via CSI VolumeSnapshot](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/5005)
    Users can now utilize the unified CSI VolumeSnapshot interface to manage Backing Images similar to volume snapshots and backups.

  - [Snapshot Cleanup & Delete Recurring Job](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/3836)
    Introducing two new recurring job types specifically designed for snapshot cleanup and deletion. These jobs allow users to remove unnecessary snapshots for better space efficiency.

  - [CIFS Backup Store](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/3599) & [Azure Backup Store](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/1309)
    To enhance users' backup strategies and align with data governance policies, Longhorn now supports additional backup storage protocols, including CIFS and Azure.

  - [Kubernetes Upgrade Node Drain Policy](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/3304)  
    The new Node Drain Policy provides flexible strategies to protect volume data during Kubernetes upgrades or node maintenance operations. This ensures the integrity and availability of your volumes.
