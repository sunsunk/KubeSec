## Service Mesh Performance Roadmap

#### Area: Specification
- Enhance workload metadata model with integration with Open Application Model.
- Enhance service mesh configuration model with integration with Service Mesh Interface.

#### Area: Publication
- Identification of representative workloads.
- Establishment of standard benchmark configurations.
- Characterization of comparative differences (apples-to-oranges) performance comparisons of service mesh deployments.
- Continous publication of service mesh performance benchmarks on CNCF and IEEE venues.

#### Area: Participation
- Increase individual service mesh project participation.
- Exchange of performance information from system-to-system / mesh-to-mesh.

#### Area: Research
- collaborative, academic research on a universal performance index to gauge a service mesh’s efficiency against deployments in other organizations’ environments.
- collaborative, academic research on performance characterization of new distributing tracing sampling algorithms.
