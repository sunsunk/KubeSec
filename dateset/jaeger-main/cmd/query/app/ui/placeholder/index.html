        <h1>ðŸ¥‹: This is not the Jaeger UI you are looking for!</h1>
        <p>
            This is a placeholder for the Jaeger UI home page.
            If you are seeing this, you are running a binary that was not compiled with the UI assets (<code>-tags ui</code>).
            See <a href="https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#running-local-build-with-the-ui">these instructions</a>.
        </p>
        <h1>UI configuration</h1>
        <p>
            The section below emulates the corresponding content in <b>jaeger-ui/packages/jaeger-ui/index.html</b>
            which contains placeholders that are replaced on startup by the query-service in order to customize
            the UI configuration.
            See <a href="https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/tree/main/packages/jaeger-ui#configuration">README</a> for more details.
        </p>
        <!-- exact variable names below are important and must match index.html in the UI as well as the regex's in query-service -->
