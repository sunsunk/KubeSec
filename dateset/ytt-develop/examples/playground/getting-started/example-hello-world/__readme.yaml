  =============
  Hello, World!
  =============

  Welcome to the ytt getting started tutorial.
  
  ytt is a general-purpose YAML and text templating tool.
  
  For our tutorial, we will use real-world examples
  from a common use-case: managing Kubernetes configuration.
  You need not know Kubernetes.
  
  The goal is to ease your learning ytt.

  We will:
  - introduce one concept at a time;
  - share ways of "Thinking in ytt" so you can be more
    productive;
  - point out common gotchas and give insight designed to
    unstick you.
  
  We recommend you:
  - take your time. these examples are meant to be 
    thought-provoking;
  - go in sequence, each lesson builds from the last;
  - poke, play, and break things; learn by doing.
  
  -----------------
  YAML in, YAML out
  -----------------

  There is no ytt code in the YAML, below.
  Yet... there are SIX (6) differences between the input
  and the output. Can you spot them all?

  With no logic in the template, why are there these
  differences?

  ytt:
  1) compiles your YAML file into a tree of YAML nodes;
  2) applies edits to those YAML nodes;
  3) encodes those YAML nodes into YAML-formatted text
     output.

  No need to escape output, ytt does that for you.
  No need to ensure well-formed output, ytt does that for
  you.

  ................
  Thinking in ytt:

          "build structures...

                        ...don't template text."
