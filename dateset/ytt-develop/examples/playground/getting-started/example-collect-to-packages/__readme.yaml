  =============================
  Collect Modules into Packages
  =============================

  Naming each and every file has started to get out of hand.

  In ytt, you can specify a directory and it will scan that
  directory (and sub-directories) for all files.

  Our project now looks like this:

  config
  ├── common.lib.yml
  ├── consts.star
  ├── deployment.yml
  ├── service.yml
  └── values.yml

  And our `ytt` command-line looks sane again.

  We say `config` is a package containing two templates,
  a data value file, and two modules.

  ................
  Thinking in ytt:

  "Packages gather files that go together...

                          ...and separate those that do not."
