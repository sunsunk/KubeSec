  Extending Data Values
  =====================

  In our last example, we learned how to modify the value
  of an existing data value. Sometimes, you need a new data
  value in order to add more configuration.

  `ytt` will report an error when a schema overlay includes
  a Data Value that was not previously defined in schema.
  You can override this behavior by telling `ytt` that 
  you expect the data value to be new.

  In our example, we...
  - add a new data value, `ingress_path`, of type string;
  - annotate that data value, indicating that it is "ok"
    if the data value is not already present (aka 
    "missing");
  - further annotate it, indicating that it should be 
    `null` by default;
  - reference this new data value our new template â€”
    `prod/ingress.yml`; adding the new ingress only if a
    path was actually specified (i.e. not null).

  Let's see this at play...
  1. What happens when you remove the `#@overlay/match`
     annotation?
  2. What happens when you specify an `ingress_path`?

  -----------
  Annotations
  -----------

  In ytt, `#@` denotes an annotation on the YAML node to its
  left or below it (when there is none to its left).

  A YAML parser interprets `#` as a comment, ignoring the
  rest. The annotation comes alive when ytt "executes" the
  file.

  In most cases, we deliberately place an annotation on a
  specific YAML node:

  - `#@overlay/match missing_ok=True` is annotating
    `ingress_path: ""`, informing the overlay mechanism that
     this map item node's key is possibly not present in the
     target map (i.e. the map in `config/schema.yml`).

  - back in `config/schema.yml`, we annotated the Document
    node starting on line 2 as a "data values schema"
    document.

  - `#@ if/end data.values.ingress_path:` is annotating the
    Document node starting on line 4.

  Let's explore:

  1. in `prod/schema.yml` ensure `ingress_path` is annotated
     as "nullable". Note that `prod/ingress.yml` is absent 
     from the output column.

  2. in `prod/ingress.yml` move `#@ if/end ...` from line 3
     to just below `kind: Ingress` and above `metadata:`.
     What changes in the output?

  3. in `prod/schema.yml` remove the `#@data/values-schema`
     annotation. What happened to the data values declared in
     that Document?

     - reinforce this by removing the `#@ if/end` entirely
       from `prod/ingress.yml` and replace the reference to
       `data.values.ingress_path` with an empty string.
       (see the new "template" appear in the output?)

  ................
  Thinking in ytt:

      "Adding a data value...

                       ...is extending the contract."
