# Welcome to Volcano

Volcano is a batch system built on Kubernetes. It provides a suite of mechanisms currently missing from
Kubernetes that are commonly required by many classes of batch & elastic workload including:

1. machine learning/deep learning,
2. bioinformatics/genomics
3. other "big data" applications.

These types of applications typically run on generalized domain
frameworks like TensorFlow, Spark, Ray, PyTorch, MPI, etc, which Volcano integrates with.
